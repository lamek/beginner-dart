Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focused on using a `switch` statement for control flow, themed around a simple Day Planner, along with its solution.

## Dart Beginner Problem: Simple Day Planner

**Problem Description:**

Create a simple command-line application in Dart that acts as a basic day planner.

1.  The program should prompt the user to enter a day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.).
2.  Read the user's input.
3.  Use a `switch` statement to check the entered day (case-insensitive).
4.  Based on the day, print a suggested activity:
    *   **Monday:** "Plan the week's goals."
    *   **Tuesday:** "Focus on a key project task."
    *   **Wednesday:** "Mid-week check-in and review."
    *   **Thursday:** "Learn something new."
    *   **Friday:** "Wrap up tasks and relax."
    *   **Saturday:** "Enjoy your weekend! Maybe do some chores?"
    *   **Sunday:** "Prepare for the upcoming week."
5.  If the user enters text that doesn't match any day of the week, print an "Invalid day entered." message.

**Goal:** Practice reading user input and using `switch` statements for conditional logic based on string values.

## Dart Solution Code:

```dart
import 'dart:io'; // Import the dart:io library for input/output operations

void main() {
  // 1. Prompt the user for input
  print('Enter the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday...):');

  // 2. Read the user's input
  // readLineSync() reads a line of text from the console.
  // It can return null if there's no input, so we use String?
  String? dayInput = stdin.readLineSync();

  // Basic input validation: Check if input is null or empty
  if (dayInput == null || dayInput.isEmpty) {
    print('No input received. Exiting.');
    return; // Exit the program if input is invalid
  }

  // Normalize the input: Trim whitespace and convert to lowercase
  // This makes the switch statement case-insensitive.
  String day = dayInput.trim().toLowerCase();

  // 3. Use a switch statement to suggest an activity
  print('\nSuggested Activity:'); // Add a newline for better formatting

  switch (day) {
    case 'monday':
      // 4. Print activity for Monday
      print("Plan the week's goals.");
      break; // Exit the switch statement

    case 'tuesday':
      // 4. Print activity for Tuesday
      print("Focus on a key project task.");
      break;

    case 'wednesday':
      // 4. Print activity for Wednesday
      print("Mid-week check-in and review.");
      break;

    case 'thursday':
      // 4. Print activity for Thursday
      print("Learn something new.");
      break;

    case 'friday':
      // 4. Print activity for Friday
      print("Wrap up tasks and relax.");
      break;

    case 'saturday':
      // 4. Print activity for Saturday
      print("Enjoy your weekend! Maybe do some chores?");
      break;

    case 'sunday':
      // 4. Print activity for Sunday
      print("Prepare for the upcoming week.");
      break;

    default:
      // 5. Handle invalid input
      print('Invalid day entered.');
      // No break needed here as it's the last case, but it's good practice
      break;
  }
}
```

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as `day_planner.dart`.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the code using the Dart VM: `dart day_planner.dart`
5.  The program will prompt you to enter a day, and then it will print the corresponding activity or an error message.
