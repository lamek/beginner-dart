Okay, here is a beginner-level Dart problem focusing on asynchronous programming with `async`/`await` for a multi-step sequential process, along with its solution.

### Problem Description

**Title:** Simple Asynchronous Data Processing Pipeline

**Level:** Beginner

**Concept:** Asynchronous Programming (Futures, `async`/`await`)

**Goal:** Simulate a common workflow where you need to perform several asynchronous steps in a specific order: fetch some initial data, use that data to fetch more detailed data, and finally process the detailed data before displaying it.

**Scenario:**
Imagine you need to:
1.  Fetch a user ID from a simulated remote source (this takes 2 seconds).
2.  Using the fetched user ID, fetch the user's profile information (name and email) from another simulated source (this takes 3 seconds).
3.  Process the user's profile information to create a formatted display string (this takes 1 second).
4.  Print the final formatted string to the console.

**Tasks:**

1.  **`fetchUserId()` function:**
    *   Should return a `Future<int>`.
    *   Inside the function, print a message like "Fetching User ID...".
    *   Use `Future.delayed` to simulate a 2-second network delay.
    *   After the delay, return a sample user ID (e.g., `42`).

2.  **`fetchUserProfile(int userId)` function:**
    *   Should take an `int userId` as input.
    *   Should return a `Future<String>`.
    *   Inside the function, print a message like "Fetching User Profile for ID: [userId]...".
    *   Use `Future.delayed` to simulate a 3-second network delay.
    *   After the delay, return a sample user profile string (e.g., `"Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com"`).

3.  **`processUserData(String userProfile)` function:**
    *   Should take a `String userProfile` as input.
    *   Should return a `Future<String>`.
    *   Inside the function, print a message like "Processing User Data...".
    *   Use `Future.delayed` to simulate a 1-second processing time.
    *   After the delay, return a formatted string (e.g., `"Processed Profile: [ [userProfile] ]"`).

4.  **`main()` function:**
    *   Mark the `main` function as `async`.
    *   Use `await` to call the functions sequentially:
        *   Call `fetchUserId()` and store the result. Print the received ID.
        *   Call `fetchUserProfile()` using the ID obtained in the previous step and store the result. Print a confirmation message.
        *   Call `processUserData()` using the profile obtained in the previous step and store the result. Print a confirmation message.
        *   Finally, print the fully processed user data string.
    *   Include print statements at the start and end of `main` to indicate the overall process flow.

**Constraint:** You *must* use `async` and `await` to ensure the steps happen one after another.

### Solution Code

```dart
import 'dart:async';

// 1. Function to simulate fetching a user ID (takes 2 seconds)
Future<int> fetchUserId() async {
  print('Fetching User ID...');
  // Simulate network delay
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  // Return a sample user ID
  return 42;
}

// 2. Function to simulate fetching user profile based on ID (takes 3 seconds)
Future<String> fetchUserProfile(int userId) async {
  print('Fetching User Profile for ID: $userId...');
  // Simulate network delay
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
  // Return sample user profile data
  // In a real app, you'd use the userId here in an API call
  return 'Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com';
}

// 3. Function to simulate processing user data (takes 1 second)
Future<String> processUserData(String userProfile) async {
  print('Processing User Data...');
  // Simulate processing time
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  // Return formatted data
  return 'Processed Profile: [ $userProfile ]';
}

// 4. Main function orchestrating the asynchronous operations sequentially
Future<void> main() async {
  print('Starting user data pipeline...');

  try {
    // Step 1: Fetch User ID
    print('\nSTEP 1: Initiating User ID fetch...');
    int userId = await fetchUserId();
    print('-> User ID received: $userId');

    // Step 2: Fetch User Profile using the obtained ID
    print('\nSTEP 2: Initiating User Profile fetch...');
    String userProfile = await fetchUserProfile(userId);
    print('-> User Profile received.'); // Confirmation, actual data logged later

    // Step 3: Process User Data using the obtained profile
    print('\nSTEP 3: Initiating User Data processing...');
    String processedData = await processUserData(userProfile);
    print('-> User Data processed.'); // Confirmation

    // Step 4: Display the final result
    print('\n--- FINAL RESULT ---');
    print(processedData);
    print('--------------------\n');

  } catch (error) {
    // Basic error handling (optional for this beginner problem, but good practice)
    print('An error occurred: $error');
  } finally {
    print('User data pipeline finished.');
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Each function (`fetchUserId`, `fetchUserProfile`, `processUserData`) is marked `async` because it uses `await` internally (for `Future.delayed`). They return `Future` objects, signifying that their results will be available later.
2.  `Future.delayed` is used to simulate time-consuming operations like network requests or heavy computation without actually blocking the program.
3.  The `main` function is also marked `async` because it needs to use `await`.
4.  Inside `main`, `await` is used before each function call (`fetchUserId()`, `fetchUserProfile(userId)`, `processUserData(userProfile)`). This pauses the execution of `main` *at that line* until the `Future` returned by the called function completes.
5.  The result of the completed `Future` (e.g., the `int` from `fetchUserId`, the `String` from `fetchUserProfile`) is then assigned to the variable (e.g., `userId`, `userProfile`).
6.  Because `await` pauses execution until the previous step is done, the sequence is guaranteed: User ID is fetched *before* profile fetching starts, and profile is fetched *before* processing starts.
7.  The `print` statements help visualize the order and timing of operations when you run the code.
