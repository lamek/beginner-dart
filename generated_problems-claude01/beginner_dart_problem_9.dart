Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focusing on operators, specifically a logical password checker, along with its solution.

**Problem Description: Logical Password Checker**

**Goal:** Write a Dart function that validates a password based on two criteria: length and content.

**Rules:**
A password is considered **valid** if it meets **both** of the following conditions:
1.  It is **at least 8 characters** long.
2.  It contains **at least one number** (0-9) **OR** **at least one special character** (for simplicity, let's consider `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `(`, `)` as special characters).

**Task:**
Create a Dart function named `isPasswordValid` that:
*   Takes a single `String` argument representing the password.
*   Returns `true` if the password meets both criteria mentioned above.
*   Returns `false` otherwise.

You will need to use:
*   Comparison operators (e.g., `>=`) to check the length.
*   Logical operators (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR) to combine the conditions.
*   A way to check if the string contains specific characters (Hint: You can use `String.contains()` or regular expressions).

**Example Usage:**
```
isPasswordValid("short")       // Should return false (too short)
isPasswordValid("longenough")  // Should return false (long enough, but no number/special)
isPasswordValid("longw1thnum") // Should return true (long enough, has number)
isPasswordValid("longw!thspc") // Should return true (long enough, has special char)
isPasswordValid("Long1!")      // Should return true (long enough, has number and special char)
isPasswordValid("7char!")      // Should return false (too short)
```

**Dart Solution**

```dart
import 'dart:core'; // Usually implicit, but good to know RegExp is here

// Function to check if the password meets the criteria
bool isPasswordValid(String password) {
  // --- Rule 1: Check Length ---
  // Use the comparison operator '>=' to check if length is 8 or more.
  bool hasMinLength = password.length >= 8;

  // --- Rule 2: Check Content (Number OR Special Character) ---

  // Check for at least one number (0-9)
  // RegExp(r'\d') matches any digit. .hasMatch() returns true if found.
  bool hasNumber = RegExp(r'\d').hasMatch(password);

  // Check for at least one special character from our defined set
  // RegExp(r'[!@#$%^&*()]') matches any character inside the brackets.
  // Note: Some characters like ^, *, () have special meaning in regex,
  // but inside square brackets [], they often lose their special meaning
  // and are treated literally.
  bool hasSpecialChar = RegExp(r'[!@#$%^&*()]').hasMatch(password);

  // Use the logical OR operator '||' to check if EITHER condition is met.
  bool hasNumberOrSpecial = hasNumber || hasSpecialChar;

  // --- Combine Rules ---
  // Use the logical AND operator '&&' to check if BOTH the length
  // rule AND the content rule are met.
  bool isValid = hasMinLength && hasNumberOrSpecial;

  // Return the final result
  return isValid;
}

// Main function to test the isPasswordValid function
void main() {
  List<String> testPasswords = [
    "short",        // Invalid: Too short
    "longenough",   // Invalid: No number or special char
    "longw1thnum", // Valid: Meets length and has number
    "longw!thspc", // Valid: Meets length and has special char
    "Long1!",      // Valid: Meets length, has both
    "7char!",      // Invalid: Too short
    "alllowercasebutlong1", // Valid
    "ALLUPPERCASEBUTLONG!", // Valid
    "N0Sp&ci@lCh@r",      // Valid
  ];

  print("--- Password Validation Results ---");
  for (String pass in testPasswords) {
    bool isValid = isPasswordValid(pass);
    print("Password: '$pass' \t -> Is Valid? $isValid");
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`isPasswordValid(String password)` Function:** Takes the password string as input.
2.  **`hasMinLength`:** Uses the `>=` comparison operator on `password.length` to check if it's 8 or more. Stores the boolean result.
3.  **`hasNumber`:** Uses a Regular Expression (`RegExp(r'\d')`) which matches any digit character. `hasMatch(password)` returns `true` if the password string contains at least one digit.
4.  **`hasSpecialChar`:** Uses another Regular Expression (`RegExp(r'[!@#$%^&*()]')`) which matches any single character that is present within the square brackets `[]`. `hasMatch(password)` returns `true` if any of these special characters are found.
5.  **`hasNumberOrSpecial`:** Uses the logical OR `||` operator. This variable becomes `true` if `hasNumber` is `true`, OR if `hasSpecialChar` is `true` (or both).
6.  **`isValid`:** Uses the logical AND `&&` operator. This variable becomes `true` only if `hasMinLength` is `true` AND `hasNumberOrSpecial` is also `true`.
7.  **`return isValid;`:** The function returns the final boolean result.
8.  **`main()` Function:** Sets up a list of test passwords and iterates through them, calling `isPasswordValid` for each and printing the password along with its validation status. This demonstrates how to use the function.
