Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focusing on classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with its solution.

### Problem Description: Animal Sounds

**Goal:** Practice creating classes, using inheritance, and demonstrating polymorphism in Dart.

**Scenario:** You need to model different types of animals and make them produce their characteristic sounds.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create a Base Class:** Define an `abstract` class named `Animal`.
    *   This class should have an `abstract` method called `makeSound()` which takes no arguments and returns `void`. Abstract methods don't have an implementation in the base class; they *must* be implemented by any concrete subclass.
2.  **Create Subclasses:**
    *   Define a class named `Dog` that **inherits** from `Animal`.
        *   Implement the `makeSound()` method in the `Dog` class to print "Woof!".
    *   Define a class named `Cat` that **inherits** from `Animal`.
        *   Implement the `makeSound()` method in the `Cat` class to print "Meow!".
3.  **Demonstrate Polymorphism:**
    *   In the `main` function:
        *   Create a `List` that can hold `Animal` objects.
        *   Add at least one `Dog` object and one `Cat` object to this list.
        *   Iterate through the list using a loop.
        *   Inside the loop, call the `makeSound()` method on each `Animal` object in the list.
    *   Observe how the correct sound (`Woof!` or `Meow!`) is printed depending on the *actual* type of the object (`Dog` or `Cat`), even though you are calling the method on a variable of type `Animal`. This is polymorphism in action.

### Solution Code

```dart
// 1. Create the Base Class (Abstract)
abstract class Animal {
  // Abstract method - must be implemented by subclasses
  void makeSound();
}

// 2. Create Subclasses

// Dog subclass inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Provide the implementation for the abstract method
  @override // Good practice to indicate method override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Woof!");
  }
}

// Cat subclass inheriting from Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
  // Provide the implementation for the abstract method
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Meow!");
  }
}

// 3. Demonstrate Polymorphism
void main() {
  // Create a list that holds Animal objects
  // We can add Dog and Cat objects because they ARE Animals (inheritance)
  List<Animal> animals = [
    Dog(), // Create a Dog instance
    Cat(), // Create a Cat instance
    Dog(), // Create another Dog instance
    Cat(), // Create another Cat instance
  ];

  print("--- Demonstrating Polymorphism ---");

  // Iterate through the list of animals
  for (Animal animal in animals) {
    // Call makeSound() on each animal.
    // Dart determines at runtime which specific version of makeSound()
    // (Dog's or Cat's) should be executed based on the object's actual type.
    animal.makeSound();
  }

  print("--- End of Demonstration ---");
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`abstract class Animal`**: Declares a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a template for subclasses.
2.  **`abstract void makeSound();`**: Declares a method signature without an implementation. Any non-abstract class extending `Animal` *must* provide its own version of `makeSound`.
3.  **`class Dog extends Animal`**: `Dog` inherits properties and methods (in this case, the requirement to implement `makeSound`) from `Animal`.
4.  **`@override void makeSound() { ... }`**: `Dog` provides its specific implementation for `makeSound`. The `@override` annotation is good practice to indicate you're intentionally replacing a method from the superclass.
5.  **`class Cat extends Animal`**: Similar to `Dog`, `Cat` inherits from `Animal` and provides its own `makeSound`.
6.  **`List<Animal> animals = [ ... ];`**: Creates a list where each element is expected to be an `Animal` or a subtype of `Animal`.
7.  **`for (Animal animal in animals)`**: Loops through the list. The variable `animal` is of type `Animal`.
8.  **`animal.makeSound();`**: This is the core of polymorphism. Even though the *variable* `animal` is typed as `Animal`, the program calls the `makeSound` method belonging to the *actual object* stored in the variable at that moment (either a `Dog` or a `Cat`). This allows you to treat different objects uniformly (as `Animal`s) while still getting their specific behaviors.
