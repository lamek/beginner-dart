Okay, here is the Dart problem and solution.

---

**Problem Description**

**Goal:** Write a Dart function to determine if a given integer is a prime number.

**Details:**
1.  Create a function named `isPrime` that accepts one integer parameter named `num`.
2.  The function should return a boolean value: `true` if `num` is a prime number, and `false` otherwise.
3.  Remember:
    *   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
    *   Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
    *   2 is the smallest and only even prime number.

**Example Usage:**
*   `isPrime(7)` should return `true`.
*   `isPrime(10)` should return `false`.
*   `isPrime(1)` should return `false`.
*   `isPrime(2)` should return `true`.

**Solution Code**

```dart
import 'dart:math'; // Needed for sqrt function (optional optimization)

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool isPrime(int num) {
  // 1. Handle edge cases: Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
  if (num <= 1) {
    return false;
  }

  // 2. Handle the special case of 2 (the only even prime).
  //    We could let the loop handle it, but this is slightly clearer/faster.
  if (num == 2) {
    return true;
  }

  // 3. Optimization: Even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.
  //    This check isn't strictly necessary if the loop starts at 2,
  //    but it quickly eliminates half the numbers.
  if (num % 2 == 0) {
    return false;
  }

  // 4. Check for divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number.
  //    We only need to check odd divisors because we already handled even numbers.
  //    Checking up to sqrt(num) is sufficient because if a number n has a divisor d > sqrt(n),
  //    it must also have a divisor n/d < sqrt(n).
  int limit = sqrt(num).toInt();
  for (int i = 3; i <= limit; i += 2) { // Increment by 2 to check only odd numbers
    if (num % i == 0) {
      // Found a divisor other than 1 and itself, so it's not prime.
      return false;
    }
  }

  // 5. If no divisors were found in the loop, the number is prime.
  return true;
}

// Main function to demonstrate the isPrime function
void main() {
  int number1 = 7;
  int number2 = 10;
  int number3 = 1;
  int number4 = 2;
  int number5 = 13;
  int number6 = 9; // Non-prime odd number

  print("$number1 is prime? ${isPrime(number1)}"); // Expected: true
  print("$number2 is prime? ${isPrime(number2)}"); // Expected: false
  print("$number3 is prime? ${isPrime(number3)}"); // Expected: false
  print("$number4 is prime? ${isPrime(number4)}"); // Expected: true
  print("$number5 is prime? ${isPrime(number5)}"); // Expected: true
  print("$number6 is prime? ${isPrime(number6)}"); // Expected: false
}
```
