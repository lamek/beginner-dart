Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focused on using a `for` loop to generate a multiplication table, along with its solution.

**Problem Description**

**Title:** Multiplication Table Generator

**Objective:** Write a Dart program that prints the multiplication table for a specific number, from 1 up to 10.

**Requirements:**

1.  Define an integer variable to hold the number for which you want to generate the table (e.g., `int number = 5;`).
2.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the multipliers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
3.  Inside the loop, calculate the product of the `number` and the current multiplier.
4.  Print each line of the multiplication table in a clear format, for example:
    ```
    5 x 1 = 5
    5 x 2 = 10
    ...
    5 x 10 = 50
    ```

**Hint:** You can use string interpolation with the `print()` function to format the output nicely.

**Dart Solution**

```dart
// Entry point of the Dart program
void main() {
  // 1. Define the number for the multiplication table
  int number = 7; // You can change this number to generate a different table (e.g., 5, 9, 12)

  print('Multiplication Table for $number:');
  print('--------------------------'); // Optional separator for clarity

  // 2. Use a 'for' loop to iterate from 1 to 10
  //    'i' will represent the multiplier in each step
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    // 3. Calculate the product for the current iteration
    int result = number * i;

    // 4. Print the result in the desired format using string interpolation
    print('$number x $i = $result');
  }

  print('--------------------------'); // Optional separator
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `void main()`: The starting point of every Dart application.
2.  `int number = 7;`: Declares an integer variable `number` and initializes it with `7`. This is the number whose multiplication table we want to see.
3.  `print(...)`: Used to display output to the console. The first `print` statement acts as a title.
4.  `for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)`: This is the `for` loop:
    *   `int i = 1;`: Initializes a loop counter variable `i` to 1.
    *   `i <= 10;`: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.
    *   `i++`: Increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.
5.  `int result = number * i;`: Inside the loop, this line calculates the product of the `number` and the current value of the multiplier `i`.
6.  `print('$number x $i = $result');`: This line prints the formatted string for each step of the multiplication table. The `$` sign is used for string interpolation, embedding the values of the variables `number`, `i`, and `result` directly into the string.
