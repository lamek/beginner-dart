**Problem Description**

**Title:** Rectangle Area vs. Perimeter Comparison

**Objective:** Write a Dart program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle and then determines if the area is strictly greater than the perimeter.

**Tasks:**

1.  Define two variables, `length` and `width`, and assign them numeric values (e.g., `10` and `5`). You can use `int` or `double`.
2.  Calculate the **area** of the rectangle using the formula: `area = length * width`. Store this in a variable called `area`.
3.  Calculate the **perimeter** of the rectangle using the formula: `perimeter = 2 * (length + width)`. Store this in a variable called `perimeter`.
4.  Use a **comparison operator** (`>`) to check if the calculated `area` is greater than the calculated `perimeter`. Store the boolean result (true or false) in a variable called `isAreaGreaterThanPerimeter`.
5.  Print the following information to the console:
    *   The calculated area.
    *   The calculated perimeter.
    *   The result of the comparison (whether the area is greater than the perimeter).

**Operators to use:**
*   Arithmetic: `*` (multiplication), `+` (addition)
*   Comparison: `>` (greater than)

**Dart Solution**

```dart
void main() {
  // 1. Define length and width
  double length = 10.0; // You can change these values
  double width = 5.0;  // You can change these values

  // 2. Calculate Area
  double area = length * width;

  // 3. Calculate Perimeter
  // Using parentheses ensures addition happens before multiplication by 2
  double perimeter = 2 * (length + width);

  // 4. Compare Area and Perimeter
  bool isAreaGreaterThanPerimeter = area > perimeter;

  // 5. Print the results
  print("--- Rectangle Calculations ---");
  print("Given Length: $length");
  print("Given Width: $width");
  print("------------------------------");
  print("Calculated Area: $area");
  print("Calculated Perimeter: $perimeter");
  print("------------------------------");
  print("Is the Area greater than the Perimeter? $isAreaGreaterThanPerimeter");
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The `main` function is the entry point of the Dart program.
2.  We declare `length` and `width` as `double` to allow for non-integer dimensions, initializing them with sample values.
3.  The `area` is calculated using the multiplication operator `*`.
4.  The `perimeter` is calculated using addition `+` and multiplication `*`. Parentheses `()` are crucial to ensure the correct order of operations (addition first, then multiplication).
5.  A boolean variable `isAreaGreaterThanPerimeter` stores the result of comparing `area` and `perimeter` using the greater than operator `>`.
6.  Finally, `print()` statements are used to display the input values, the calculated results, and the comparison outcome in a user-friendly format. String interpolation (`$variableName`) is used to easily include variable values within the strings.
