Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focused on basic class inheritance and method overriding, along with its solution.

**Problem Description**

**Topic:** Classes and Objects (Basic Inheritance & Method Overriding)

**Goal:** Understand how to create a subclass that inherits from a base class and overrides one of its methods.

**Task:**

1.  **Create a Base Class:** Define a class named `Animal`.
    *   Inside the `Animal` class, create a method named `makeSound()` that prints the text "Some generic animal sound".
2.  **Create a Subclass:** Define a class named `Dog` that *inherits* from the `Animal` class.
3.  **Override the Method:** Inside the `Dog` class, *override* the `makeSound()` method so that it prints the text "Woof!" instead of the generic sound.
4.  **Instantiate and Call:** In the `main` function of your Dart program:
    *   Create an instance (object) of the `Dog` class.
    *   Call the `makeSound()` method on the `Dog` object you just created.

**Expected Output:**

When you run the program, it should print the following to the console:

```
Woof!
```

**Dart Solution Code**

```dart
// Base class (Superclass)
class Animal {
  // Method in the base class
  void makeSound() {
    print("Some generic animal sound");
  }
}

// Derived class (Subclass) inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Overriding the makeSound method from the Animal class
  @override // Good practice annotation to indicate overriding
  void makeSound() {
    print("Woof!"); // Specific sound for Dog
  }
}

// Main function - the entry point of the program
void main() {
  // Create an instance (object) of the Dog class
  Dog myDog = Dog();

  // Call the makeSound method on the Dog object.
  // Since Dog overrides this method, the Dog's version will be executed.
  myDog.makeSound();
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The `Animal` class defines a basic structure with a `makeSound` method.
2.  The `Dog` class uses `extends Animal` to inherit everything public from `Animal`.
3.  The `@override` annotation before `makeSound` in the `Dog` class signifies that we are intentionally providing a new implementation for a method that already exists in the parent (`Animal`) class.
4.  When `myDog.makeSound()` is called in `main`, Dart looks for the `makeSound` method first in the `Dog` class. Since it finds an overridden version there, it executes that version, printing "Woof!". If `Dog` hadn't overridden the method, the version from the `Animal` class would have been executed instead (printing "Some generic animal sound").
