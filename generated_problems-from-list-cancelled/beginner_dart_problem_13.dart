Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focused on `for` loops and `if` statements, based on your description.

**Dart Control Flow Problem: Print Even Numbers**

**Problem Description:**

Write a Dart program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 20 (inclusive). For each number, determine if it is even. If the number is even, print it to the console.

**Requirements:**

1.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 up to and including 20.
2.  Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current number is even.
3.  Use the modulo operator (`%`) to help determine if a number is even (Hint: A number is even if it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2).
4.  Print only the even numbers, each on a new line.

**Expected Output:**

```
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
```

**Solution:**

```dart
// Entry point of the Dart program
void main() {
  // Print a descriptive header (optional, but good practice)
  print("Even numbers between 1 and 20:");

  // Use a 'for' loop to iterate from 1 to 20
  // 'int i = 1' initializes the loop counter 'i' to 1.
  // 'i <= 20' sets the condition for the loop to continue (as long as 'i' is less than or equal to 20).
  // 'i++' increments 'i' by 1 after each iteration.
  for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
    // Inside the loop, check if the current number 'i' is even.
    // The modulo operator '%' gives the remainder of a division.
    // If 'i % 2' equals 0, it means 'i' is perfectly divisible by 2, hence even.
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      // If the condition is true (the number is even), print the number.
      print(i);
    }
    // If the number is odd, the 'if' condition is false, and nothing is printed for that iteration.
  }
}
```
