Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focused on polymorphism using class inheritance, along with its solution.

**Problem Description**

**Topic:** Classes and Objects (Inheritance, Polymorphism)

**Goal:** Demonstrate polymorphism using different animal types.

**Scenario:**
You have a base class `Animal` which knows how to `makeSound()`. You also have a `Dog` class that inherits from `Animal` and overrides `makeSound()` to print "Woof!".

**Your Tasks:**

1.  **Define the `Animal` Class:** Create a class named `Animal` with a method `makeSound()` that prints "Some generic animal sound".
2.  **Define the `Dog` Class:** Create a class named `Dog` that inherits from `Animal`. Override the `makeSound()` method in `Dog` to print "Woof!".
3.  **Define the `Cat` Class:** Create a class named `Cat` that inherits from `Animal`. Override the `makeSound()` method in `Cat` to print "Meow!".
4.  **Create a List of Animals:** In your `main` function, create a `List` that can hold `Animal` objects.
5.  **Populate the List:** Add one instance (object) of `Dog` and one instance of `Cat` to the list.
6.  **Demonstrate Polymorphism:** Loop through the `List<Animal>`. Inside the loop, call the `makeSound()` method on each element. Observe that even though you are calling the method on an `Animal` type reference, the specific overridden method for `Dog` or `Cat` is executed.

**Expected Output:**
```
Woof!
Meow!
```

**Solution Code**

```dart
// 1. Define the Animal Class
class Animal {
  // Base method
  void makeSound() {
    print("Some generic animal sound");
  }
}

// 2. Define the Dog Class inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Override the base method
  @override // Annotation indicating intention to override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Woof!");
  }
}

// 3. Define the Cat Class inheriting from Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
  // Override the base method
  @override // Annotation indicating intention to override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Meow!");
  }
}

void main() {
  // 4. Create a List that can hold Animal objects
  // We explicitly type the list with <Animal>
  List<Animal> animals = [];

  // 5. Populate the List with specific animal instances
  Dog myDog = Dog();
  Cat myCat = Cat();

  animals.add(myDog); // Add a Dog object
  animals.add(myCat); // Add a Cat object

  // Alternative way to create and populate the list in one step:
  // List<Animal> animals = [Dog(), Cat()];

  print("Looping through animals and calling makeSound():");

  // 6. Demonstrate Polymorphism
  // Loop through the list. Even though 'animal' is typed as 'Animal',
  // Dart calls the specific overridden method of the actual object (Dog or Cat).
  for (Animal animal in animals) {
    animal.makeSound(); // Polymorphic call
  }
}
```

**Explanation of Polymorphism:**

In the `for` loop, the variable `animal` is declared with the type `Animal`. However, during the first iteration, it holds a `Dog` object, and during the second iteration, it holds a `Cat` object. When `animal.makeSound()` is called, Dart determines the *actual* type of the object stored in `animal` at runtime and executes the `makeSound` method belonging to that specific subclass (`Dog` or `Cat`). This ability to treat objects of different subclasses in a uniform way (as their base class type) while still getting their specialized behavior is called polymorphism.
