Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focusing on operators for an age eligibility check, along with its solution.

## Problem Description

**Title:** Voting Age Eligibility Check

**Concept:** Using Comparison Operators in Dart

**Scenario:**
You need to write a simple Dart program to check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The minimum voting age is legally defined.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Define a Constant:** Declare an integer constant named `minimumVotingAge` and set it to `18`.
2.  **Get User Input:** Prompt the user to enter their age and read the input from the console. Assume the user will enter a valid integer.
3.  **Parse Input:** Convert the user's input (which is initially a String) into an integer.
4.  **Compare Ages:** Use a comparison operator (`>=`) to compare the user's age with the `minimumVotingAge`.
5.  **Print Result:** Print the boolean result (`true` if the user is eligible, `false` otherwise) directly to the console.

**Example Interaction:**

```
Please enter your age:
25
true
```

```
Please enter your age:
17
false
```

## Solution

```dart
import 'dart:io'; // Import the io library for input/output

void main() {
  // 1. Define the minimum voting age constant
  const int minimumVotingAge = 18;

  // 2. Prompt the user for their age
  print('Please enter your age:');

  // 3. Read user input from the console
  // stdin.readLineSync() reads a line of text entered by the user.
  // The '!' tells Dart we are sure the result won't be null (use with caution,
  // or preferably add null checking as shown in more robust examples).
  String? input = stdin.readLineSync();

  // Basic input check (optional but good practice)
  if (input == null || input.isEmpty) {
    print('No input provided. Exiting.');
    return; // Exit the program if input is null or empty
  }

  // 4. Parse the input string to an integer
  // int.tryParse() is safer as it returns null if parsing fails.
  int? userAge = int.tryParse(input);

  // Check if parsing was successful
  if (userAge == null) {
    print('Invalid input. Please enter a number for age. Exiting.');
    return; // Exit if input is not a valid integer
  }
  
  // Optional: Check for non-sensical ages like negative numbers
  if (userAge < 0) {
      print('Age cannot be negative. Exiting.');
      return;
  }

  // 5. Compare the user's age with the minimum voting age
  // The comparison operator '>=' checks if userAge is greater than OR equal to minimumVotingAge.
  // The result of this comparison is directly assigned to the boolean variable 'isEligible'.
  bool isEligible = userAge >= minimumVotingAge;

  // 6. Print the boolean result
  // This will print either 'true' or 'false' to the console.
  print(isEligible);
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`import 'dart:io';`**: This line imports the necessary library to allow interaction with the Input/Output streams, specifically for reading console input (`stdin`).
2.  **`const int minimumVotingAge = 18;`**: Declares an integer constant. `const` means its value is fixed at compile-time.
3.  **`print('Please enter your age:');`**: Displays a message asking the user for input.
4.  **`String? input = stdin.readLineSync();`**: Reads the line of text the user types into the console and stores it in the `input` variable. It's nullable (`String?`) because `readLineSync` can potentially return `null`.
5.  **Input Validation (`if (input == null ...)` and `if (userAge == null ...)`):** These checks handle cases where the user might not enter anything or enters text that isn't a valid number. `int.tryParse()` attempts to convert the string to an integer; if it fails (e.g., the user typed "abc"), it returns `null`.
6.  **`bool isEligible = userAge >= minimumVotingAge;`**: This is the core logic. It compares `userAge` to `minimumVotingAge` using the "greater than or equal to" operator (`>=`). The result of this comparison (either `true` or `false`) is stored in the `isEligible` boolean variable.
7.  **`print(isEligible);`**: This line prints the final boolean value (`true` or `false`) stored in the `isEligible` variable to the console.
