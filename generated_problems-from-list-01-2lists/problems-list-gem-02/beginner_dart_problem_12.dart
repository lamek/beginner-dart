**Problem Description**

**Title:** Print Numbers 1 to N

**Objective:** Write a Dart program that prints all the integer numbers from 1 up to a specified positive integer `n`.

**Requirements:**

1.  Declare an integer variable named `n` and assign it a positive integer value (e.g., 10).
2.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers.
3.  The loop should start at 1 and go up to and including the value of `n`.
4.  Inside the loop, print each number. Each number should preferably be on a new line.

**Example Output (if n = 5):**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

**Solution Code**

```dart
// Entry point of the Dart program
void main() {
  // 1. Declare an integer variable 'n' and assign it a value.
  //    You can change this value to test with different upper limits.
  int n = 10; 

  print("Printing numbers from 1 to $n:"); // Optional: Print a descriptive message

  // 2. Use a 'for' loop to iterate from 1 up to n (inclusive).
  //    - 'int i = 1;' initializes the loop counter 'i' to 1.
  //    - 'i <= n;' is the condition; the loop continues as long as 'i' is less than or equal to 'n'.
  //    - 'i++' increments 'i' by 1 after each iteration.
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    
    // 4. Print the current value of 'i' inside the loop.
    print(i); 
  }
}
```
