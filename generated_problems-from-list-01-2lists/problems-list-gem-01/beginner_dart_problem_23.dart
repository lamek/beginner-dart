Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focusing on basic class inheritance and method overriding, along with its solution.

**Problem Description**

**Topic:** Classes and Objects (Basic Inheritance & Polymorphism)

**Goal:** Understand how one class can inherit properties and methods from another (base) class and how a subclass can provide its own specific implementation for an inherited method (overriding).

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create a Base Class:** Define a class named `Animal`.
2.  **Add a Method:** Inside the `Animal` class, create a method named `makeSound()` that prints the text "Some generic animal sound".
3.  **Create a Subclass:** Define a class named `Dog` that *inherits* from the `Animal` class.
4.  **Override the Method:** Inside the `Dog` class, *override* the `makeSound()` method so that it prints the text "Woof!" instead of the generic sound.
5.  **Test:** In your `main` function, create an instance (object) of the `Dog` class and call its `makeSound()` method. Verify that it prints "Woof!".

**Solution Code**

```dart
// Base class
class Animal {
  // Method in the base class
  void makeSound() {
    print("Some generic animal sound");
  }
}

// Derived class (subclass) inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Overriding the makeSound method from the Animal class
  @override // Good practice to use the @override annotation
  void makeSound() {
    print("Woof!");
  }
}

void main() {
  // Create an instance (object) of the Dog class
  Dog myDog = Dog();

  // Call the makeSound method on the Dog object.
  // Because Dog overrides the method, its specific version is called.
  myDog.makeSound(); // Expected output: Woof!
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The `Animal` class defines a basic structure with a `makeSound` method.
2.  The `Dog` class uses `extends Animal` to inherit from `Animal`. This means a `Dog` *is an* `Animal` and initially gets the `makeSound` method from `Animal`.
3.  The `@override` annotation indicates that the `makeSound` method in `Dog` is intentionally replacing the one inherited from `Animal`.
4.  When `myDog.makeSound()` is called, Dart looks for the `makeSound` method first in the `Dog` class. Since it finds an overridden version there, it executes that one, printing "Woof!". If `Dog` hadn't overridden the method, the version from the `Animal` class would have been executed, printing "Some generic animal sound".
