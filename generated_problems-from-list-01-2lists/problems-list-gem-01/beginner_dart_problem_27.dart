Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem and its solution based on your description.

**Problem Description**

**Topic:** Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)

**Task:** Delayed Greeting

Your goal is to create a simple asynchronous function in Dart.

1.  Define an `async` function named `greetAfterDelay` that accepts two parameters:
    *   `name` (a `String`)
    *   `seconds` (an `int` representing the delay duration).
2.  The function should return a `Future<void>` because it won't return a specific value, but its completion signifies an action has finished.
3.  Inside the function, use `Future.delayed` to pause execution for the specified number of `seconds`. You'll need to create a `Duration` object using `Duration(seconds: seconds)`.
4.  After the delay, the function should print a greeting to the console in the format: "Hello, \[name]!".
5.  In the `main` function, call `greetAfterDelay` with a sample name (e.g., "Alice") and a delay (e.g., 3 seconds).
6.  Use the `await` keyword in `main` when calling `greetAfterDelay` to ensure the `main` function waits for the greeting to be printed before potentially exiting or continuing. Remember that `main` must be marked `async` to use `await`.
7.  Add a print statement before calling `greetAfterDelay` and one after the `await` call in `main` to observe the execution flow.

**Solution Code**

```dart
import 'dart:async'; // Required for Future and Duration

// 1. Define the async function `greetAfterDelay`
// It returns Future<void> because it performs an action but doesn't return a value.
Future<void> greetAfterDelay(String name, int seconds) async {
  // 3. Use Future.delayed with the specified duration
  // We await the Future returned by Future.delayed to pause execution here.
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: seconds));

  // 4. Print the greeting after the delay
  print("Hello, $name!");
}

// 5. Call the function from main.
// 6. Mark main as async to use await.
Future<void> main() async {
  // 7. Print statement before the async call
  print("Scheduling greeting for Alice...");

  // Call the async function and wait for it to complete
  await greetAfterDelay("Alice", 3); // Example: Wait 3 seconds

  // 7. Print statement after the async call has completed
  print("Greeting delivered. Main function finished.");
}

/*
Expected Output:

Scheduling greeting for Alice...
(after approximately 3 seconds)
Hello, Alice!
Greeting delivered. Main function finished.

*/
```
