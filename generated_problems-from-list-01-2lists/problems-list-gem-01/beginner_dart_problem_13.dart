**Problem Description**

**Title:** Print Even Numbers

**Objective:** Write a Dart program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 20 (inclusive) and prints only the even numbers.

**Requirements:**

1.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 up to and including 20.
2.  Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current number is even.
3.  To check for evenness, use the modulo operator (`%`). A number is even if `number % 2` equals `0`.
4.  If the number is even, print it to the console. Each even number should appear on a new line.

**Expected Output:**

```
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
```

**Solution**

```dart
// Entry point of the Dart program
void main() {
  print("Printing even numbers from 1 to 20:");

  // 1. Use a 'for' loop to iterate from 1 to 20
  //    - 'int i = 1': Initializes the loop counter 'i' to 1.
  //    - 'i <= 20': The loop continues as long as 'i' is less than or equal to 20.
  //    - 'i++': Increments 'i' by 1 after each iteration.
  for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {

    // 2. Inside the loop, use an 'if' statement to check for evenness
    //    - 'i % 2': Calculates the remainder when 'i' is divided by 2.
    //    - '== 0': Checks if the remainder is exactly 0.
    if (i % 2 == 0) {

      // 3. If the condition is true (the number is even), print the number
      print(i);
    }
    // If the number is odd (i % 2 != 0), the code inside the 'if' block is skipped.
  }

  print("Finished printing even numbers.");
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The `main` function is where the program execution begins.
2.  A `for` loop is set up with a counter variable `i` starting at 1.
3.  The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 20.
4.  In each iteration, the `if` statement checks the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
5.  The modulo operator `%` gives the remainder of a division. If `i` divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, it means `i` is an even number.
6.  If the condition is true (the number is even), the `print(i);` statement inside the `if` block is executed, displaying the even number on the console.
7.  If the condition is false (the number is odd), the `print(i);` statement is skipped.
8.  The loop increments `i` (`i++`) and repeats the process until `i` becomes greater than 20.
