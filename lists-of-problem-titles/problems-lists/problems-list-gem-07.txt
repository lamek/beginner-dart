Okay, here are 5 beginner coding exercise ideas for each category in the requested format:

**Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)**
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Rectangle Area Calculator:
Declare variables for the length and width of a rectangle (using `int` or `double`). Calculate the area (length * width). Print the result with a descriptive message."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Personal Profile:
Create variables for your name (`String`), age (`int`), height (`double`), and whether you are a student (`bool`). Print these variables using string interpolation in a sentence."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Favorite Colors List:
Create a `List<String>` to store your favorite colors. Add a new color to the list. Remove a color. Print the final list of colors."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Student Grades Map:
Create a `Map<String, double>` to store student names and their corresponding grades (e.g., 'Alice': 95.0). Add a new student and grade. Print the grade of a specific student."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Simple Boolean Check:
Create an integer variable `num`. Create a boolean variable `isPositive` that is true if `num` is greater than 0, and false otherwise. Print the value of `num` and `isPositive`."

**Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)**
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Shopping Cart Total:
Define variables for the price of three items (`double`) and a tax rate (`double`). Calculate the subtotal, the tax amount, and the final total using arithmetic operators. Print each value."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Age Comparison:
Create two integer variables representing the ages of two people. Use comparison operators (>, <, ==, >=, <=, !=) to print whether person 1 is older, younger, or the same age as person 2."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Login Access Check:
Create boolean variables `isLoggedIn` and `isAdmin`. Use logical operators (&&, ||, !) to print whether a user has admin access (must be logged in AND be an admin)."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Temperature Alert:
Create a `double` variable for the current temperature. Use comparison operators to print "Warning: Too Hot!" if temperature > 30, "Warning: Too Cold!" if temperature < 10, and "Temperature is normal" otherwise."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Remainder Finder:
Take two integers, a dividend and a divisor. Calculate and print the remainder using the modulo operator (%). Also, print the integer result of the division."

**Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)**
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Number Sign Classifier:
Take an integer input. Use if-else if-else statements to classify the number as positive, negative, or zero. Print the classification."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Print Even Numbers (For Loop):
Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 20. Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current number is even. Print only the even numbers."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Countdown Timer (While Loop):
Use a `while` loop to count down from 10 to 1. Print each number. After the loop finishes, print "Liftoff!".
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Simple Menu (Switch Statement):
Create an integer variable `menuChoice` (e.g., 1, 2, 3). Use a `switch` statement to print a different action based on the choice (e.g., 1: "Start Game", 2: "Load Game", 3: "Exit"). Include a default case for invalid choices."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Iterate Over List (For Loop):
Create a `List<String>` of fruits. Use a `for-in` loop (or standard `for` loop with index) to iterate through the list and print each fruit name."

**Functions (parameters, return values)**
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Greeter Function:
Create a function `greet` that takes a `String` name as a parameter and prints a personalized greeting message (e.g., "Hello, [name]! How are you?"). Call this function with different names."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Multiplication Function:
Create a function `multiply` that takes two `double` parameters and returns their product (`double`). Call the function with sample numbers and print the returned result."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Is Positive Function:
Create a function `isPositive` that takes an `int` parameter and returns `true` if the number is greater than 0, `false` otherwise. Call the function and print the boolean result."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
String Length Function:
Create a function `getStringLength` that takes a `String` as input and returns its length (`int`). Call the function with a few different strings and print their lengths."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Average Calculator Function:
Create a function `calculateAverage` that takes a `List<double>` of numbers as a parameter and returns their average (`double`). Handle the case of an empty list (e.g., return 0.0). Call the function with a sample list and print the average."

**Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)**
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Simple `Car` Class:
Create a `Car` class with properties like `make` (String), `model` (String), and `year` (int). Add a constructor to initialize these. Create an instance (object) of `Car` and print its details."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Counter` Class with Methods:
Create a `Counter` class with an integer property `count`. Add methods `increment()` (increases count by 1), `decrement()` (decreases count by 1), and `getCount()` (returns the current count). Create an instance and test the methods."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Vehicle` and `Bicycle` Inheritance:
Create a base `Vehicle` class with a `speed` property and a `displaySpeed()` method. Create a `Bicycle` class that inherits from `Vehicle`. Add a `gear` property to `Bicycle`. Create instances of both and call `displaySpeed()`."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Shape` Area (Polymorphism):
Create a base `Shape` class with an abstract method `calculateArea()` returning a `double`. Create `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes inheriting from `Shape`, implementing `calculateArea()` appropriately. Create instances and call `calculateArea()`."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Animal` Sounds (Polymorphism):
Create an `Animal` base class with a `makeSound()` method (e.g., prints "Generic animal sound"). Create `Dog` and `Cat` classes inheriting from `Animal`, overriding `makeSound()` (e.g., "Woof!", "Meow!"). Create a `List<Animal>`, add `Dog` and `Cat` objects, loop through, and call `makeSound()` on each."

**Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)**
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Delayed Greeting (Future):
Create a function that returns a `Future<String>`. Use `Future.delayed` to wait 3 seconds, then have the Future complete with a greeting message ("Hello after 3 seconds!"). Use `.then()` to print the message."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Fetch User Name (async/await):
Create an `async` function `fetchUserName` that simulates fetching data by using `await Future.delayed` for 2 seconds, then returns a username (`String`, e.g., "DartUser"). Call this function using `await` in `main` (make `main` async) and print the result."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulate Multiple Downloads (async/await):
Create two `async` functions, `downloadFile1` and `downloadFile2`, each returning a `Future<String>` (e.g., "File 1 data", "File 2 data") after different delays (1 sec, 3 sec). Call both sequentially using `await` in an `async` function and print results."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Concurrent Fetch (Future.wait):
Using the `downloadFile1` and `downloadFile2` functions from the previous exercise, use `Future.wait` to run them concurrently. Use `await` on the `Future.wait` result and print the list of results once both complete."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulated Network Error Handling:
Create an `async` function `fetchData` that simulates a network request. Use `Future.delayed`. Randomly either return a success `String` or throw an `Exception("Network Error")`. Call this function using `await` within a `try-catch` block to handle both success and error cases."
