Okay, here are 5 beginner coding exercise ideas for each category in the requested format for Dart:

"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Temperature Converter:
Create variables to store Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. Write code to convert between the two using the formula: F=(C*9/5)+32 and C=(F-32)*5/9. Print the results with appropriate labels."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Grocery List:
Create a List<String> of grocery items. Add a few items, remove one, and check if a specific item exists. Print the final list and the result of the check."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Personal Profile:
Declare variables for name (String), age (int), height (double, e.g., in meters), and isStudent (bool). Assign values and print a summary sentence combining these variables."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Simple Product Catalog:
Create a Map<String, double> where keys are product names (String) and values are their prices (double). Add a few products. Access and print the price of one product. Update the price of another."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Rectangle Area and Perimeter:
Declare two double variables, `width` and `height`. Calculate the area (`width * height`) and perimeter (`2 * (width + height)`). Store the results in separate variables and print them."

"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Simple Calculator:
Take two numbers (int or double) as input (or define them as variables). Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and find the remainder (modulo). Print the results of each operation clearly labeled."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Number Comparison:
Define two integer variables. Use comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) to compare them. Print the boolean result of each comparison (e.g., "Is number1 greater than number2? true")."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Even or Odd Checker:
Define an integer variable. Use the modulo operator (%) to determine if the number is even or odd (`number % 2 == 0`). Print whether the number is "Even" or "Odd"."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Eligibility Check:
Define variables for age (int) and hasLicense (bool). Use logical operators (&&, ||) to check if a person is eligible to drive (e.g., age >= 18 AND hasLicense is true). Print the eligibility status."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Increment/Decrement Practice:
Declare an integer variable `counter` initialized to 0. Use the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators (both prefix and postfix) and print the value of `counter` after each operation to observe the difference."

"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Grade Classifier:
Define a variable for a student's numerical grade (e.g., 85). Use if-else if-else statements to classify the grade into categories (e.g., A: 90+, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: <60). Print the letter grade."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Counting Loop (1 to 10):
Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, each on a new line."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Countdown Loop (10 to 1):
Use a `while` loop to print a countdown from 10 down to 1, followed by "Blast off!". Make sure the loop terminates correctly."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Day of the Week Printer:
Define an integer variable representing the day number (1 for Monday, 7 for Sunday). Use a `switch` statement to print the corresponding day name. Include a `default` case for invalid numbers."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Sum of Even Numbers:
Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 20. Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current number is even. If it is, add it to a running total. Print the final sum after the loop."

"Functions (parameters, return values)
Greeting Function:
Create a function `greetUser` that takes a `String` name as a parameter and prints a personalized greeting like "Hello, [name]!". Call this function with a few different names."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Addition Function:
Create a function `addNumbers` that takes two `double` parameters and returns their sum (`double`). Call the function with sample numbers and print the returned result."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
isPositive Function:
Create a function `isPositive` that takes an `int` number as a parameter and returns a `bool`: `true` if the number is greater than 0, `false` otherwise. Test it with positive, negative, and zero values."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
String Length Function:
Create a function `getStringLength` that takes a `String` as input and returns its length (`int`). Call the function with different strings and print their lengths."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
List Sum Function:
Create a function `calculateListSum` that takes a `List<int>` as a parameter and returns the sum (`int`) of all its elements. Handle the case of an empty list (return 0). Test with a sample list."

"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Simple `Dog` Class:
Define a class `Dog` with properties for `name` (String) and `breed` (String). Add a constructor to initialize these properties and a method `bark()` that prints "Woof!". Create an instance (object) of `Dog` and call its `bark()` method."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Rectangle` Class with Area:
Define a class `Rectangle` with `width` and `height` (double) properties. Include a constructor and a method `calculateArea()` that returns the area. Create a `Rectangle` object and print its area."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Vehicle` Inheritance:
Create a base class `Vehicle` with a method `startEngine()` that prints "Engine started.". Create a derived class `Car` that extends `Vehicle` and overrides `startEngine()` to print "Car engine started.". Create instances of both and call their methods."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Counter` Class:
Define a class `Counter` with an integer property `count` initialized to 0. Add methods `increment()` (increases count by 1) and `getCount()` (returns the current count). Create a `Counter` object, increment it a few times, and print the count."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Shape` Polymorphism:
Create a base class `Shape` with a method `draw()` that prints "Drawing a shape". Create two derived classes, `Circle` and `Square`, that extend `Shape` and override `draw()` to print "Drawing a circle" and "Drawing a square" respectively. Create a `List<Shape>` containing instances of `Circle` and `Square`, loop through it, and call `draw()` on each element."

"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Delayed Greeting:
Create an `async` function that uses `Future.delayed` for 3 seconds and then returns the String "Hello after 3 seconds!". Use `await` to call this function and print the result when it's available."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulated File Download:
Create an `async` function `downloadFile(String url)` that simulates downloading by delaying for 2 seconds using `Future.delayed` and then returns "Downloaded content from [url]". Call it with `await` and print the message."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Fetch User Name (Mock):
Create an `async` function `fetchUserName()` that waits for 1 second using `Future.delayed` and returns a mock user name like "Alice". Call this function using `await` and print "User found: [name]".
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Chained Async Calls:
Create two `async` functions: `stepOne()` waits 1 second and returns 10; `stepTwo(int input)` waits 1 second and returns `input * 2`. Call `stepOne` with `await`, then pass its result to `stepTwo` using `await`, and print the final result."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Async Operation with Status:
Create an `async` function `longOperation()`. Print "Operation started...", wait for 2 seconds using `Future.delayed`, then print "Operation complete!". Call this function using `await` in your main `async` function."
