Okay, here are 5 beginner coding exercise ideas for each category, formatted as requested, suitable for learning Dart:

**Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)**

"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Personal Profile:
Create variables to store your name (String), age (int), height in meters (double), and whether you are a student (bool). Print each variable with a descriptive label.",
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Simple Calculation:
Declare two integer variables, `num1` and `num2`. Assign them values. Calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient (as a double). Store each result in a separate variable and print them.",
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Favorite Hobbies List:
Create a List<String> to store your favorite hobbies. Add at least three hobbies. Print the hobby at index 1. Then, remove one hobby and print the final list.",
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Simple Dictionary (Map):
Create a Map<String, String> to store translations (e.g., 'hello' -> 'hola'). Add three word pairs. Look up the translation for one word and print it. Print the entire map.",
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Shopping Cart Total:
Create a List<double> representing prices of items in a shopping cart. Calculate the total cost by summing the prices. Create a boolean variable `hasDiscountCoupon` and print a message indicating if a discount will be applied (just print the boolean's value for now)."

**Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)**

"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Rectangle Area and Perimeter:
Declare variables for the length and width of a rectangle. Calculate the area (length * width) and perimeter (2 * (length + width)) using arithmetic operators. Print both results.",
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Age Eligibility Check:
Declare an integer variable `age`. Use comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=) to check if the age is sufficient for voting (18 or older). Print a boolean result (true or false).",
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Even or Odd Checker:
Declare an integer variable `number`. Use the modulo operator (%) to determine if the number is even or odd (Hint: `number % 2 == 0`). Print a message indicating whether it's even or odd.",
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Login Access Logic:
Declare two boolean variables: `isUsernameCorrect` and `isPasswordCorrect`. Use the logical AND operator (&&) to determine if login access should be granted. Print the boolean result.",
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Discount Eligibility:
Declare variables for customer `age` (int) and `isMember` (bool). Use comparison and logical operators (e.g., `||`, `&&`, `>=`) to check if a customer is eligible for a discount (e.g., age >= 65 OR isMember is true). Print the boolean eligibility result."

**Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)**

"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Number Sign Checker:
Declare an integer variable `number`. Use if-else if-else statements to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero. Print the corresponding message.",
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Print Numbers 1 to 10:
Use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and print each number on a new line.",
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Countdown Timer:
Use a `while` loop to count down from 5 to 1. Print each number, and after the loop finishes, print "Blast off!".",
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Day of the Week Printer:
Declare an integer variable `dayNumber` (1-7). Use a `switch` statement to print the corresponding day name (e.g., 1 -> "Monday", 7 -> "Sunday"). Include a default case for invalid numbers.",
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Sum of List Elements:
Create a List<int> with several numbers. Use a `for` loop (or a for-in loop) to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of all its elements. Print the final sum."

**Functions (parameters, return values)**

"Functions (parameters, return values)
Greeting Function:
Create a function named `greetUser` that takes a `String` parameter `name`. The function should print a greeting message like "Hello, [name]!". Call the function with your name.",
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Addition Function:
Create a function named `add` that takes two `int` parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum (`int`). Call the function with two numbers and print the returned result.",
"Functions (parameters, return values)
isEven Function:
Create a function named `isEven` that takes an `int` parameter `number` and returns a `bool` indicating whether the number is even (true) or odd (false). Test it with different numbers and print the results.",
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Calculate Rectangle Area Function:
Create a function `calculateArea` that takes `double width` and `double height` as parameters and returns the calculated area (`double`). Call this function and print the area for a specific rectangle.",
"Functions (parameters, return values)
List Average Function:
Create a function `calculateAverage` that takes a `List<double>` as a parameter and returns the average (`double`) of the numbers in the list. Handle the case of an empty list (return 0.0). Test it with a list of numbers."

**Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)**

"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Simple `Person` Class:
Define a class named `Person` with properties for `name` (String) and `age` (int). Create a constructor to initialize these properties. Create an instance (object) of `Person` and print its name and age.",
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Dog` Class with Method:
Define a class named `Dog` with properties `name` (String) and `breed` (String). Add a method `bark()` that prints "Woof!". Create a `Dog` object and call its `bark()` method.",
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Basic Inheritance - `Vehicle` and `Car`:
Define a base class `Vehicle` with a property `speed` (double). Define a subclass `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds a property `numberOfDoors` (int). Create an instance of `Car` and set its properties.",
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`BankAccount` Class:
Define a class `BankAccount` with a `double balance` property (initialize to 0). Add methods `deposit(double amount)` and `withdraw(double amount)` that update the balance. Add a `getBalance()` method that returns the current balance. Create an account object and test the methods.",
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Simple Polymorphism - `Animal` Sounds:
Define a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()` that prints "Some generic sound". Create two subclasses, `Cat` and `Dog`, that override `makeSound()` to print "Meow" and "Woof!" respectively. Create a `List<Animal>` containing a `Cat` and a `Dog` object, and loop through the list calling `makeSound()` on each."

**Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)**

"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulated Delayed Message:
Create an asynchronous function `fetchDelayedMessage` that waits for 2 seconds using `Future.delayed` and then returns the String "Message received!". Use `async`/`await` to call this function and print the message.",
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulate User Data Fetch:
Create an async function `fetchUserData` that simulates fetching data by waiting for 1 second and returning a `Map<String, dynamic>` like `{'name': 'Alice', 'id': 123}`. Call this function and print the fetched user name.",
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Sequential Async Operations:
Create two async functions: `fetchUserId()` (waits 1s, returns 45) and `fetchUserName(int id)` (waits 1s, returns "Bob" if id is 45). Call `fetchUserId`, then use its result to call `fetchUserName`, printing the final name.",
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Handling Potential Async Error:
Create an async function `fetchDataOrError` that randomly (or based on input) either returns "Data fetched successfully" after 1 second or throws an Exception("Network error"). Call this function using `await` inside a `try-catch` block to handle both success and error cases.",
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Waiting for Multiple Futures:
Create two async functions, `taskOne()` (waits 1s, returns "Task 1 Complete") and `taskTwo()` (waits 2s, returns "Task 2 Complete"). Use `Future.wait()` to run both concurrently and print both results once they are *both* finished."
