Okay, here are 5 beginner coding exercise ideas for each category, formatted as requested, suitable for learning Dart:

**Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)**

"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Simple Profile Creator:
Create variables for name (String), age (int), height (double), and isStudent (bool). Assign values and print them out with descriptive labels like 'Name: John Doe'."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Rectangle Area & Perimeter:
Create variables for the width and height of a rectangle (using int or double). Calculate the area (width * height) and perimeter (2 * (width + height)). Print both results."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Favorite Colors List:
Create a List<String> to store your favorite colors. Add at least three colors. Print the first color, the total number of colors, and then the entire list."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Product Inventory (Map):
Create a Map<String, int> to represent product inventory (e.g., 'Apples': 10, 'Bananas': 5). Add a new product, update the stock of an existing product, and print the final inventory map."
"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Temperature Converter:
Create variables to store Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures (double). Write code to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit F=(C*9/5)+32 and vice-versa C=(F-32)*5/9. Print both converted results."

**Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)**

"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Simple Calculator:
Take two numbers (int or double). Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Print each result clearly labeled."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Even or Odd Checker:
Take an integer input. Use the modulo operator (%) to determine if the number is even or odd. Print 'Even' or 'Odd' based on the result."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Age Check for Discount:
Create an age variable (int) and a boolean variable `isMember`. Use comparison (>=, <) and logical (&&, ||) operators to check if a person is eligible for a discount (e.g., age >= 65 or (age < 18 && isMember)). Print whether they get the discount."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Number Comparison:
Take two integer inputs. Use comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) to compare them. Print messages like 'Number 1 is greater than Number 2', 'Numbers are equal', etc."
"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Increment/Decrement Counter:
Create an integer variable `counter` initialized to 0. Use the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators to increase it by 1 twice and decrease it by 1 once. Print the value of `counter` after each operation."

**Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)**

"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Positive, Negative, or Zero:
Take an integer input. Use if-else if-else statements to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero. Print the corresponding message."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Print Numbers 1 to 10:
Use a for loop to iterate from 1 up to and including 10. Print each number on a new line inside the loop."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Countdown Timer:
Use a while loop to print numbers counting down from 5 to 1, followed by 'Blast off!'. Make sure the loop eventually terminates."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Day of the Week Printer:
Take an integer input representing the day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.). Use a switch statement to print the corresponding day name. Include a default case for invalid input."
"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Iterate Through List:
Create a List<String> of fruits (e.g., ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']). Use a for-in loop to iterate through the list and print each fruit name."

**Functions (parameters, return values)**

"Functions (parameters, return values)
Greeting Function:
Create a function `greetUser(String name)` that takes a name as a parameter and prints a personalized greeting like 'Hello, [name]! Welcome.'."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Addition Function:
Create a function `addNumbers(int a, int b)` that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. Call the function and print the returned result."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Calculate Rectangle Area Function:
Create a function `calculateArea(double width, double height)` that takes width and height as parameters and returns the calculated area. Call it with sample values and print the result."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Is Even Function:
Create a function `isEven(int number)` that takes an integer and returns a boolean (`true` if the number is even, `false` otherwise). Use the modulo operator inside. Test it and print the boolean result."
"Functions (parameters, return values)
Combine Strings Function:
Create a function `combineStrings(String str1, String str2)` that takes two strings and returns a single string that is the concatenation of the two with a space in between. Print the combined string."

**Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)**

"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Simple `Car` Class:
Define a `Car` class with properties for `make` (String), `model` (String), and `year` (int). Add a method `displayInfo()` that prints these details. Create an instance (object) of `Car` and call its `displayInfo()` method."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Counter` Class:
Define a `Counter` class with an integer property `count`. Add methods `increment()` which adds 1 to `count`, `decrement()` which subtracts 1, and `getCount()` which returns the current count. Create an instance and test the methods."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Animal` Inheritance:
Create a base class `Animal` with a method `speak()`. Create two subclasses, `Dog` and `Cat`, that inherit from `Animal` and override the `speak()` method to print 'Woof!' and 'Meow!' respectively. Create instances of `Dog` and `Cat` and call their `speak()` methods."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Using Polymorphism with Animals:
Using the `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` classes from the previous exercise, create a `List<Animal>` containing both a `Dog` object and a `Cat` object. Iterate through the list and call the `speak()` method on each element, observing the different outputs."
"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Book` Class with Constructor:
Define a `Book` class with `title` and `author` (String) properties. Create a constructor that accepts the title and author as arguments and initializes the properties. Add a `display()` method. Instantiate a `Book` using the constructor and call `display()`."

**Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)**

"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Delayed Message:
Create an `async` function `printDelayedMessage()` that waits for 3 seconds using `Future.delayed()` and then prints 'Message arrived after 3 seconds!'. Call this function using `await` in your `main` function."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulate Fetching User Name:
Create an `async` function `fetchUserName()` that simulates a network request by waiting 2 seconds (`Future.delayed`) and then returns a `Future<String>` containing a username (e.g., 'Alice'). Call it using `await` and print the fetched username."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulate Sequential Tasks:
Create two `async` functions, `task1()` and `task2()`, each using `Future.delayed` for different durations (e.g., 1 second, 2 seconds) and printing a message when done. Call them sequentially using `await` in `main` to ensure `task2` starts only after `task1` completes."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulate Fetching Number:
Create an `async` function `fetchRandomNumber()` that waits 1 second (`Future.delayed`) and returns a `Future<int>` (e.g., returns 42). Use `await` to get the number and then print it."
"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Combine Two Delayed Results:
Create two `async` functions, `fetchDataA()` returning `Future<String>` after 1 second, and `fetchDataB()` returning `Future<String>` after 2 seconds. Use `await` to get both results and then print them combined or concatenated."
