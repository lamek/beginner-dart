Okay, here are 5 beginner coding exercise ideas for each category, formatted as requested, suitable for learning Dart:

**Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)**

Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Personal Profile:
Create variables to store your name (String), age (int), height in meters (double), and whether you are a student (bool). Print each variable with a descriptive label.

Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Rectangle Calculations:
Declare two double variables for the width and height of a rectangle. Calculate its area (width * height) and perimeter (2 * (width + height)). Print the results.

Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Shopping List Manager:
Create a `List<String>` to represent a shopping list. Add three items, remove one, and then print the final number of items and the list itself.

Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Student Gradebook:
Create a `Map<String, int>` where keys are subject names (Strings) and values are grades (ints). Add at least three subjects and their grades. Print the grade for a specific subject.

Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Simple Boolean Logic:
Create two boolean variables, `isRaining` and `haveUmbrella`. Print a message indicating whether it's safe to go out (e.g., "Go out" if not raining or if have umbrella, "Stay inside" otherwise).

**Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)**

Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Basic Calculator:
Declare two integer variables. Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Print each result.

Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Age Comparator:
Declare two integer variables representing the ages of two people. Use comparison operators (>, <, ==) to determine and print if person 1 is older, younger, or the same age as person 2.

Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Discount Calculator:
Declare a double variable for an item's price and a boolean `isMember`. If the price is greater than $50 AND the customer is a member, apply a 10% discount (price * 0.9). Print the final price.

Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Even or Odd Determiner:
Declare an integer variable. Use the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is even or odd. Print the result (e.g., "The number is even." or "The number is odd.").

Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Temperature Check:
Declare a double variable for temperature in Celsius. Use comparison operators (<, >) and logical operators (&&) to print if the temperature is suitable for shorts (e.g., between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius).

**Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)**

Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Grade Classifier:
Declare an integer variable for a student's score (0-100). Use if-else if-else statements to print the corresponding letter grade (e.g., 90-100: A, 80-89: B, etc.).

Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Counting with For Loop:
Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, each on a new line.

Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Simple Number Guessing Prompt:
Use a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user to guess a secret number (predefined, e.g., 7). The loop should continue as long as the guess is incorrect. (Note: Requires input handling, might be slightly advanced for absolute beginners but good for `while`). *Alternative simpler while:* Countdown from 5 using a while loop.

Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Day of the Week Printer:
Declare an integer variable representing a day number (1-7). Use a `switch` statement to print the corresponding day name (1: "Monday", 2: "Tuesday", ..., 7: "Sunday"). Include a default case for invalid numbers.

Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Summation with For Loop:
Use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. Print the final sum.

**Functions (parameters, return values)**

Functions (parameters, return values)
Personalized Greeter Function:
Create a function `greetUser` that takes a `String` parameter `name` and prints a personalized greeting like "Hello, [name]!". Call this function with your name.

Functions (parameters, return values)
Addition Function:
Create a function `addNumbers` that takes two `int` parameters and returns their sum (`int`). Call the function with two numbers and print the returned result.

Functions (parameters, return values)
Rectangle Area Function:
Create a function `calculateRectangleArea` that takes two `double` parameters, `width` and `height`, and returns their product (`double`). Call the function and print the area.

Functions (parameters, return values)
Is Even Function:
Create a function `isEven` that takes an `int` parameter and returns a `bool` indicating whether the number is even (`true`) or odd (`false`). Call the function and print the result.

Functions (parameters, return values)
List Average Calculator Function:
Create a function `calculateAverage` that takes a `List<double>` as a parameter and returns the average (`double`) of the numbers in the list. Handle the case of an empty list (e.g., return 0).

**Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)**

Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Basic Person Class:
Define a `Person` class with `name` (String) and `age` (int) properties. Add a method `introduceYourself()` that prints "Hi, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old.". Create an instance (object) of `Person` and call the method.

Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Simple Dog Class:
Define a `Dog` class with `breed` (String) property and a `bark()` method that prints "Woof!". Create two different `Dog` objects (e.g., Labrador, Poodle) and make them bark.

Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Counter Class:
Define a `Counter` class with an integer property `count` initialized to 0. Add methods `increment()`, `decrement()`, and `getCount()` which returns the current count. Create a `Counter` object and test its methods.

Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Basic Vehicle Inheritance:
Define a base class `Vehicle` with a `speed` property and a `move()` method printing "Moving at [speed] km/h". Create a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle`, adds a `numberOfDoors` property, and overrides `move()` to print "Car driving at [speed] km/h". Create a `Car` object and call `move()`.

Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Book Class and Inventory:
Define a `Book` class with `title` and `author` (both Strings). Create a constructor to initialize these properties. Create a `List<Book>` and add several `Book` objects to it. Iterate through the list and print the title and author of each book.

**Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)**

Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Delayed Greeting:
Use `Future.delayed` with a `Duration` of 2 seconds to print a message "Hello after 2 seconds!" after the delay. Use `.then()` or `async/await` to handle the Future.

Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulated Data Fetch:
Create an `async` function `fetchUserData()` that simulates fetching data by waiting for 3 seconds using `Future.delayed` and then returns a `Map<String, String>` like `{'name': 'Alice', 'id': '123'}`. Call this function using `await` and print the fetched user name.

Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Sequential Async Tasks:
Create two simple `async` functions, `task1()` and `task2()`, each using `Future.delayed` for 1 second before printing "Task 1 complete" and "Task 2 complete". Call them sequentially using `await` inside another `async` function `runTasks()` to ensure Task 1 finishes before Task 2 starts.

Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Async Function Returning Value:
Create an `async` function `fetchWeather()` that uses `Future.delayed` for 1 second and then returns the String "Sunny". Call this function using `await` and print the returned weather forecast.

Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simple Future Value:
Create a function `getImmediateData()` that returns an already completed `Future<String>` using `Future.value("Data is ready")`. Use `await` to get the value from the future and print it.
