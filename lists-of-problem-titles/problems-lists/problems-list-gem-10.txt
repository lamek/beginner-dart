Okay, here are 5 beginner coding exercise ideas for each category in the requested format:

**Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)**

"Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Personal Profile:
Create variables to store your name (String), age (int), height in meters (double), and whether you are a student (bool). Print a sentence combining these variables.",
    "Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Simple Interest Calculator:
Define variables for principal amount (double), rate of interest (double), and time in years (int). Calculate the simple interest (principal * rate * time / 100) and print the result.",
    "Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Favorite Hobbies:
Create a List<String> to store your favorite hobbies. Add at least three hobbies. Print the number of hobbies and then print each hobby on a new line.",
    "Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Student Grades Map:
Create a Map<String, int> to store student names (keys) and their scores (values). Add entries for 3 students. Print the score of a specific student by accessing the map using their name.",
    "Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)
Boolean Flags:
Create boolean variables like `isRaining`, `isCold`, `hasUmbrella`. Assign them true/false values. Print messages based on these flags (e.g., "Bring an umbrella!" if `isRaining` is true)."

**Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)**

"Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Rectangle Area and Perimeter:
Take the width and height of a rectangle as input (or define them as variables). Calculate the area (width * height) and perimeter (2 * (width + height)) using arithmetic operators. Print both results.",
    "Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Age Check:
Define an age variable (int). Use comparison operators (`>=`, `<`) to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18. Print a message indicating whether the person is an adult or a minor.",
    "Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Even or Odd Number Checker:
Take an integer as input. Use the modulo operator (`%`) to determine if the number is even or odd (number % 2 == 0). Print the result.",
    "Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Login Eligibility:
Create boolean variables `isUsernameValid` and `isPasswordValid`. Use the logical AND operator (`&&`) to determine if a user is eligible to log in (both must be true). Print the eligibility status.",
    "Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Discount Applicability:
Define variables for total purchase amount (double) and membership status (bool `isMember`). Use logical OR (`||`) and comparison (`>`) operators to check if a discount applies (e.g., amount > $50 OR isMember is true). Print whether the discount is applicable."

**Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)**

"Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Positive, Negative, or Zero:
Take a number as input. Use if-else if-else statements to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero. Print the appropriate message.",
    "Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Countdown Timer:
Use a `while` loop to print numbers counting down from 10 to 1. After the loop finishes, print "Blast off!".",
    "Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Print List Elements:
Create a List of strings (e.g., names of fruits). Use a `for` loop (or `forEach`) to iterate through the list and print each element.",
    "Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Menu Selection:
Simulate a simple menu using a `switch` statement. Take an integer input (1-4) representing menu options (e.g., 1: View Profile, 2: Edit Settings, 3: Logout, 4: Exit). Print a message corresponding to the selected option.",
    "Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)
Sum of First N Numbers:
Take an integer 'N' as input. Use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 up to N. Print the final sum."

**Functions (parameters, return values)**

"Functions (parameters, return values)
Greeting Function:
Create a function `greetUser` that takes a `String` parameter `name`. The function should print a personalized greeting message like "Hello, [name]!". Call the function with your name.",
    "Functions (parameters, return values)
Addition Function:
Create a function `addNumbers` that takes two `int` parameters and returns their sum (`int`). Call the function with sample numbers and print the returned result.",
    "Functions (parameters, return values)
Temperature Conversion Function:
Create a function `celsiusToFahrenheit` that takes a `double` temperature in Celsius as a parameter and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit (using the formula F=(C*9/5)+32). Call the function and print the result.",
    "Functions (parameters, return values)
isEven Function:
Create a function `isEven` that takes an `int` parameter. It should return `true` if the number is even and `false` otherwise. Call the function with an even and an odd number and print the results.",
    "Functions (parameters, return values)
Find Max Function:
Create a function `findMax` that takes two `int` parameters (`num1`, `num2`) and returns the larger of the two numbers. Call the function and print the maximum value."

**Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)**

"Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Simple `Dog` Class:
Create a class `Dog` with properties like `breed` (String) and `age` (int). Add a method `bark()` that prints "Woof!". Instantiate a `Dog` object, set its properties, and call the `bark()` method.",
    "Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
`Rectangle` Class with Area Method:
Create a class `Rectangle` with `width` and `height` (doubles) as properties. Include a method `calculateArea()` that returns the area of the rectangle. Instantiate a `Rectangle`, set its dimensions, and print the result of calling `calculateArea()`.",
    "Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Basic Inheritance: `Vehicle` -> `Car`:
Create a base class `Vehicle` with a property `speed` (int) and a method `accelerate()`. Create a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds a property `numberOfDoors` (int). Instantiate a `Car` object and access properties/methods from both `Vehicle` and `Car`.",
    "Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Method Overriding: `Animal` Sounds:
Create a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()` that prints "Generic animal sound". Create a `Cat` class inheriting from `Animal` that overrides `makeSound()` to print "Meow!". Create instances of both and call `makeSound()` on each.",
    "Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)
Polymorphic List: `Shape` Drawing:
Create an abstract base class `Shape` with an abstract method `draw()`. Create two classes, `Circle` and `Square`, that inherit from `Shape` and implement `draw()` to print "Drawing Circle" and "Drawing Square". Create a `List<Shape>` containing instances of `Circle` and `Square`, then loop through the list calling `draw()` on each element."

**Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)**

"Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Delayed Greeting:
Create an `async` function that uses `Future.delayed` to wait for 3 seconds and then prints "Hello after 3 seconds!". Call this function from your `main` function using `await`.",
    "Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulate Network Request:
Create an `async` function `fetchUserData()` that returns a `Future<String>`. Inside, use `Future.delayed` for 2 seconds, then return a dummy user name like "Alice". Call this function using `await` and print the returned user name.",
    "Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Sequential Async Operations:
Create two `async` functions, `taskOne()` and `taskTwo()`, each printing a start message, delaying for 1 second, and printing an end message. Call them sequentially using `await` in another `async` function to observe the order of execution.",
    "Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Future with `.then()`:
Rewrite the "Delayed Greeting" exercise. Instead of using `async`/`await` to call the function, call the function (which returns a Future) and use the `.then()` method to print the message when the Future completes.",
    "Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)
Simulate Failing Request:
Create an `async` function `fetchDataWithError()` that returns a `Future<String>`. Inside, use `Future.delayed` for 1 second, then throw an Exception("Network error"). Call this function using `await` inside a `try-catch` block in `main` to handle the error gracefully."
