Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focused on comparison operators for age comparison, along with its solution.

**Problem Description: Dart Age Comparison**

**Objective:** Write a Dart program that asks the user for their age and the age of another person. The program should then compare these two ages and print a message indicating who is older or if they are the same age.

**Requirements:**

1.  Import the `dart:io` library to handle user input.
2.  Prompt the user to enter their age and read the input.
3.  Prompt the user to enter another person's age and read the input.
4.  Convert the input strings to integers. You might want to handle potential errors if the user doesn't enter a valid number (though for a simple beginner problem, you can start by assuming valid input).
5.  Use comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`) to compare the two ages.
6.  Print one of the following messages based on the comparison:
    *   "You are older than the other person."
    *   "The other person is older than you."
    *   "You and the other person are the same age."

**Dart Solution Code**

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // --- Input Section ---

  // Ask for the user's age
  print("Please enter your age:");
  String? inputMyAge = stdin.readLineSync(); // Reads input as a String? (nullable)

  // Ask for the other person's age
  print("Please enter the other person's age:");
  String? inputOtherAge = stdin.readLineSync(); // Reads input as a String? (nullable)

  // --- Input Processing and Validation ---

  // Try to convert input strings to integers.
  // int.tryParse returns null if the string is not a valid integer.
  // We use the null-coalescing operator (?? '') to provide an empty string
  // to tryParse if readLineSync returns null (e.g., end-of-file).
  int? myAge = int.tryParse(inputMyAge ?? '');
  int? otherAge = int.tryParse(inputOtherAge ?? '');

  // Check if the inputs were valid numbers
  if (myAge == null || otherAge == null) {
    print("Invalid input. Please make sure to enter valid numbers for ages.");
    // Exit the program if input is invalid
    return;
  }

  // --- Comparison Logic using Comparison Operators ---

  print("\n--- Comparison Result ---"); // Add a separator for clarity

  if (myAge > otherAge) {
    // Use the > operator to check if user's age is greater
    print("You are older than the other person.");
  } else if (myAge < otherAge) {
    // Use the < operator to check if user's age is less
    print("The other person is older than you.");
  } else {
    // If neither greater nor less, they must be equal (implicitly uses ==)
    print("You and the other person are the same age.");
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`import 'dart:io';`**: Imports the necessary library for interacting with standard input/output (like reading from the console).
2.  **`main()`**: The entry point of the Dart program.
3.  **`print(...)`**: Displays messages to the user in the console.
4.  **`stdin.readLineSync()`**: Reads a line of text entered by the user from the console. It returns a `String?` (String or null).
5.  **`int.tryParse(input ?? '')`**: Attempts to convert the input `String` into an `int`. If the conversion is successful, it returns the integer; otherwise, it returns `null`. The `?? ''` handles the case where `readLineSync` might return `null`.
6.  **`if (myAge == null || otherAge == null)`**: Checks if either conversion failed. If so, it prints an error message and exits using `return;`.
7.  **`if-else if-else` block**: This structure performs the comparison:
    *   `myAge > otherAge`: Checks if `myAge` is greater than `otherAge`.
    *   `myAge < otherAge`: If the first condition is false, it checks if `myAge` is less than `otherAge`.
    *   `else`: If both previous conditions are false, it means `myAge` must be equal to `otherAge`.
8.  **Output:** Based on the comparison, the appropriate message is printed to the console.
