# Dart Problem Categories

This section organizes Dart programming problems into distinct categories, allowing you to focus on specific areas of the language. Each category includes a brief introduction and a list of problems to help you practice and reinforce your understanding.

## Available Categories

* **Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)**
    * This category focuses on working with Dart's fundamental data types and collections.
    * Problems cover variable declaration, data type conversions, and using lists and maps.
    * Examples:
        * [Temperature Converter](../problems-all/var-data/temp-convert.md)
        * [Grocery List](../problems-all/var-data/grocery-list.md)
        * [Personal Profile](../problems-all/var-data/personal-profile.md)
        * [Simple Contact Book](../problems-all/var-data/contact-book.md)
        * [Average Score Calculator](../problems-all/var-data/avg-calc.md)

* **Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)**
    * This category explores Dart's operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
    * Problems involve performing calculations, making comparisons, and using logical conditions.
    * Examples:
        * [Simple Calculator](../problems-all/operators/simple-calc.md)
        * [Even or Odd Checker](../problems-all/operators/even-odd-check.md)
        * [Age Eligibility Check](../problems-all/operators/age-compare.md)
        * [Event Access Checker](../problems-all/operators/event-access.md)
        * [Rectangle Area vs Perimeter](../problems-all/operators/discount.md)

* **Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)**
    * This category focuses on controlling the flow of execution in Dart programs.
    * Problems involve using conditional statements, loops, and switch statements.
    * Examples:
        * [Grade Calculator](../problems-all/control_flow/grade-check.md)
        * [Print Even Numbers](../problems-all/control_flow/print-even.md)
        * [Countdown Timer](../problems-all/control_flow/countdown.md)
        * [Day of the Week](../problems-all/control_flow/day-of-week.md)
        * [Factorial Calculator](../problems-all/control_flow/factorial.md)

* **Functions (parameters, return values)**
    * This category explores how to define and use functions in Dart.
    * Problems cover function parameters, return values, and function calls.
    * Examples:
        * [Rectangle Area Function](../problems-all/functions/rect-area.md)
        * [Simple Interest Function](../problems-all/functions/simple-interest.md)
        * [String Reverser](../problems-all/functions/reverse.md)
        * [Find the Maximum of 3 Numbers](../problems-all/functions/number-max.md)
        * [Temperature Conversion Function](../problems-all/functions/temp-convert-func.md)

* **Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)**
    * This category focuses on object-oriented programming concepts in Dart.
    * Problems involve defining classes, creating objects, and using inheritance and polymorphism.
    * Examples:
        * [Shape Hierarchy and Polymorphism](../problems-all/class-obj/shapes.md)
        * [Animal Sounds](../problems-all/class-obj/animal-sounds.md)
        * [Vehicles](../problems-all/class-obj/vehicles.md)
        * [Employee Hierarchy](../problems-all/class-obj/employees.md)
        * [Static Geometric Calculator](../problems-all/class-obj/geo-calc.md)

* **Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)**
    * This category explores asynchronous programming in Dart, using Futures and async/await.
    * Problems involve handling asynchronous operations, such as data fetching and delayed execution.
    * Examples:
        * [Simulated File Download](../problems-all/async/file-download.md)
        * [Simulated API Data Fetch](../problems-all/async/data-fetch.md)
        * [Concurrent Data Fetching](../problems-all/async/concurrent-data-fetch.md)
        * [Handling Future Errors](../problems-all/async/future-errors.md)
        * [Delayed Message Printer](../problems-all/async/delayed-message.md)
