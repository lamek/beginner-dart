# Dart Problem Categories

This section organizes Dart programming problems into distinct categories, allowing you to focus on specific areas of the language. Each category includes a brief introduction and a list of problems to help you practice and reinforce your understanding.

## Available Categories

* **Variables and Data Types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)**
    * This category focuses on working with Dart's fundamental data types and collections.
    * Problems cover variable declaration, data type conversions, and using lists and maps.
    * Examples:
        * [Temperature Converter](problems-all/variables/problem_variables_01.md)
        * [Grocery List](problems-all/variables/problem_variables_02.md)
        * [Personal Profile](problems-all/variables/problem_variables_03.md)
        * [Simple Contact Book](problems-all/variables/problem_variables_04.md)
        * [Average Score Calculator](problems-all/variables/problem_variables_05.md)

* **Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)**
    * This category explores Dart's operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
    * Problems involve performing calculations, making comparisons, and using logical conditions.
    * Examples:
        * [Simple Calculator](problems-all/operators/problem_operators_01.md)
        * [Even or Odd Checker](problems-all/operators/problem_operators_02.md)
        * [Age Eligibility Check](problems-all/operators/problem_operators_03.md)
        * [Discount Applicator](problems-all/operators/problem_operators_04.md)
        * [Rectangle Area vs Perimeter](problems-all/operators/problem_operators_05.md)

* **Control Flow (if-else, for loops, while loops, switch statements)**
    * This category focuses on controlling the flow of execution in Dart programs.
    * Problems involve using conditional statements, loops, and switch statements.
    * Examples:
        * [Grade Classifier](problems-all/control_flow/problem_control_flow_01.md)
        * [Number Guessing Game (Simple)](problems-all/control_flow/problem_control_flow_02.md)
        * [Print Even Numbers](problems-all/control_flow/problem_control_flow_03.md)
        * [Simple Menu (Switch)](problems-all/control_flow/problem_control_flow_04.md)
        * [Countdown Timer](problems-all/control_flow/problem_control_flow_05.md)

* **Functions (parameters, return values)**
    * This category explores how to define and use functions in Dart.
    * Problems cover function parameters, return values, and function calls.
    * Examples:
        * [Greeting Function](problems-all/functions/problem_functions_01.md)
        * [Rectangle Area Function](problems-all/functions/problem_functions_02.md)
        * [List Sum Function](problems-all/functions/problem_functions_03.md)
        * [Temperature Conversion Functions](problems-all/functions/problem_functions_04.md)
        * [Is Even Function](problems-all/functions/problem_functions_05.md)

* **Classes and Objects (inheritance, polymorphism)**
    * This category focuses on object-oriented programming concepts in Dart.
    * Problems involve defining classes, creating objects, and using inheritance and polymorphism.
    * Examples:
        * [Simple `Car` Class](problems-all/classes_objects/problem_classes_objects_01.md)
        * [`BankAccount` Class](problems-all/classes_objects/problem_classes_objects_02.md)
        * [Basic Inheritance (`Animal` -> `Dog`)](problems-all/classes_objects/problem_classes_objects_03.md)
        * [Shape Hierarchy (Area)](problems-all/classes_objects/problem_classes_objects_04.md)
        * [Polymorphism with Animals](problems-all/classes_objects/problem_classes_objects_05.md)

* **Asynchronous Programming (Futures, async/await)**
    * This category explores asynchronous programming in Dart, using Futures and async/await.
    * Problems involve handling asynchronous operations, such as data fetching and delayed execution.
    * Examples:
        * [Simulated Data Fetch](problems-all/async/problem_async_01.md)
        * [Delayed Greeting](problems-all/async/problem_async_02.md)
        * [Sequential Async Operations](problems-all/async/problem_async_03.md)
        * [Parallel Async Operations with `Future.wait`](problems-all/async/problem_async_04.md)
        * [Async Operation with Error Handling](problems-all/async/problem_async_05.md)
