# Introduction to Curated Problems

Welcome to the curated collection of Dart problems! This section is designed to guide you through the fundamentals of Dart in a structured and progressive manner.

## What to Expect

This curated path will take you through essential concepts, starting with the basics and gradually building your skills. Each problem is carefully selected to reinforce key ideas and prepare you for more advanced topics.

## How to Use This Guide

1.  **Start from the Beginning:** Begin with the first problem and work your way through the list.
2.  **Read the Explanations:** Pay close attention to the explanations provided for each problem.
3.  **Practice:** Writing code is the best way to learn. Try to solve the problems on your own before looking at the solutions.
4.  **Review:** If you encounter any difficulties, review the relevant concepts and try the problem again.

## Problems

This curated path will guide you through the following problems:

### Variables and Data Types (Focus: Basic)

* [Problem 1: Simple Variable Declaration](prob-01-variable-declaration.md) - Introducing `var`, `String`, `int`.
* [Problem 2: Working with Doubles](prob-02-working-with-doubles.md) - Basic arithmetic with `double`. (Perhaps the Temperature Converter, simplified initially)
* [Problem 3: String Manipulation](prob-03-string-manipulation.md) - Concatenation and basic string properties.

### Operators (Focus: Arithmetic and Comparison)

* [Problem 4: Basic Arithmetic Operations](prob-04-basic-arithmetic-operations.md) - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* [Problem 5: Comparison Operators](prob-05-comparison-operators.md) - Using `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

### Control Flow (Focus: if-else and basic loops)

* [Problem 6: Simple if-else](prob-06-simple-if-else.md) - Making decisions based on conditions.
* [Problem 7: for Loop Basics](prob-07-for-loop-basics.md) - Iterating a fixed number of times.
* [Problem 8: while Loop Basics](prob-08-while-loop-basics.md) - Iterating based on a condition.

### Functions (Focus: Basic parameters and return values)

* [Problem 9: Creating a Simple Function](prob-09-creating-a-simple-function.md) - A function with one parameter that performs a basic task.
* [Problem 10: Function with a Return Value](prob-10-function-with-a-return-value.md) - A function that calculates and returns a result.

### Classes and Objects (Focus: Basic instantiation and properties)

* [Problem 11: Creating a Simple Class](prob-11-creating-a-simple-class.md) - Defining a class with basic properties and creating an object.

### Expanding on Concepts (Mix of Categories)

* [Problem 12: Working with Lists](prob-12-working-with-lists.md) - Adding, accessing, and iterating through list elements.
* [Problem 13: Working with Maps](prob-13-working-with-maps.md) - Adding, accessing, and checking for keys/values in a map.
* [Problem 14: Combining Control Flow and Operators](prob-14-combining-control-flow-and-operators.md) - A problem that requires using `if/else` with comparison or logical operators.
* [Problem 15: Introduction to null safety](prob-15-introduction-to-null-safety.md) - A simple problem demonstrating the `?` operator. (Optional)
