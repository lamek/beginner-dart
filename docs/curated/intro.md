# Introduction to Curated Problems

Welcome to the curated collection of Dart problems! This section is designed to guide you through the fundamentals of Dart in a structured and progressive manner.

## What to Expect

This curated path will take you through essential concepts, starting with the basics and gradually building your skills. Each problem is carefully selected to reinforce key ideas and prepare you for more advanced topics.

## How to Use This Guide

1.  **Start from the Beginning:** Begin with the first problem and work your way through the list.
2.  **Read the Explanations:** Pay close attention to the explanations provided for each problem.
3.  **Practice:** Writing code is the best way to learn. Try to solve the problems on your own before looking at the solutions.
4.  **Review:** If you encounter any difficulties, review the relevant concepts and try the problem again.

# Variables in Dart

Variables are fundamental building blocks in any programming language, including Dart. They allow you to store and manipulate data within your programs.

## What are Variables?

In Dart, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. You can assign different values to a variable during the execution of your program.

## Declaring Variables

Dart supports various data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans. You can declare variables using the `var`, `final`, or `const` keywords.

## Problems
