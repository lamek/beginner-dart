Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focused on comparison operators for age comparison, along with its solution.

### Problem Description

**Title:** Age Comparison Program

**Objective:** Write a Dart program that asks the user for their age and the age of another person. The program should then compare the two ages using comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`) and print a message indicating who is older, or if they are the same age.

**Requirements:**

1.  Import the `dart:io` library to handle user input.
2.  Prompt the user to enter their age and read the input.
3.  Prompt the user to enter another person's age and read the input.
4.  Convert the input strings to integers. Assume the user will enter valid numbers.
5.  Use `if-else if-else` statements and comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`) to compare the two ages.
6.  Print one of the following messages based on the comparison:
    *   "You are older than the other person."
    *   "The other person is older than you."
    *   "You and the other person are the same age."

### Solution Code

```dart
import 'dart:io'; // Import the I/O library for interacting with the user

void main() {
  // 1. Prompt for and read the user's age
  print("Please enter your age:");
  String? input1 = stdin.readLineSync(); // Read input as a string (can be null)

  // 2. Prompt for and read the other person's age
  print("Please enter the other person's age:");
  String? input2 = stdin.readLineSync(); // Read input as a string (can be null)

  // 3. Convert inputs to integers
  // We use '!' to assert that the input is not null.
  // We use int.parse() to convert the String to an int.
  // Note: This will crash if the user enters non-numeric text or nothing.
  // For a beginner problem, we often assume valid input first.
  try {
    int myAge = int.parse(input1!);
    int otherAge = int.parse(input2!);

    // 4. Compare the ages using comparison operators and print the result
    if (myAge > otherAge) {
      // Check if your age is greater than the other person's age
      print("You are older than the other person.");
    } else if (myAge < otherAge) {
      // Check if your age is less than the other person's age
      print("The other person is older than you.");
    } else {
      // If neither greater nor less, the ages must be equal (==)
      print("You and the other person are the same age.");
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // Basic error handling if parsing fails (e.g., user entered text)
    print("Invalid input. Please enter numeric ages only.");
  }
}
```
