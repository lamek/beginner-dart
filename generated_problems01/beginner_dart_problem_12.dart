Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focusing on `for` loops and `if` statements to work with a number series.

### Problem Description: Printing Even Numbers

**Objective:**

Write a Dart program that prints all the even numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive).

**Requirements:**

1.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10.
2.  Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current number is even.
3.  If the number is even, print it to the console.
4.  Remember: A number is even if it is perfectly divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0). You can use the modulo operator (`%`) for this check.

**Expected Output:**

```
2
4
6
8
10
```

### Solution Code:

```dart
/// Dart Program: Printing Even Numbers between 1 and 10

void main() {
  print("Even numbers between 1 and 10:");

  // Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    
    // Check if the current number 'i' is even
    // An even number has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      // If it's even, print the number
      print(i);
    }
    // If 'i' is not even, the code inside the 'if' block is skipped,
    // and the loop continues to the next iteration.
  }
}
```
