Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focusing on classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with its solution.

---

### Problem Description

**Topic:** Dart Classes and Objects (Inheritance, Polymorphism)

**Goal:** Practice creating classes, using inheritance to create subclasses, and observing polymorphism by overriding methods.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create a Base Class `Animal`:**
    *   Define a class named `Animal`.
    *   Inside the `Animal` class, create a method named `makeSound()` that prints the text: "The animal makes a sound."

2.  **Create a Subclass `Dog`:**
    *   Define a class named `Dog` that **inherits** from the `Animal` class.
    *   **Override** the `makeSound()` method in the `Dog` class to print: "Woof! Woof!"

3.  **Create a Subclass `Cat`:**
    *   Define a class named `Cat` that **inherits** from the `Animal` class.
    *   **Override** the `makeSound()` method in the `Cat` class to print: "Meow! Meow!"

4.  **Main Function Execution:**
    *   In the `main()` function:
        *   Create an object (instance) of the `Dog` class.
        *   Call the `makeSound()` method on the `Dog` object.
        *   Create an object (instance) of the `Cat` class.
        *   Call the `makeSound()` method on the `Cat` object.
        *   *(Optional Bonus)* Create a list of type `Animal` and add both the `Dog` and `Cat` objects to it. Iterate through the list and call `makeSound()` on each element to demonstrate polymorphism.

**Expected Output:**

```
Woof! Woof!
Meow! Meow!

--- Polymorphism Demo ---
Woof! Woof!
Meow! Meow!
```
*(Output might vary slightly depending on whether you implement the bonus part)*

### Solution Code

```dart
// --- Problem Solution ---

// 1. Create a Base Class Animal
class Animal {
  // Method in the base class
  void makeSound() {
    print("The animal makes a sound.");
  }
}

// 2. Create a Subclass Dog inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Override the makeSound method for Dog
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Woof! Woof!");
  }
}

// 3. Create a Subclass Cat inheriting from Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
  // Override the makeSound method for Cat
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Meow! Meow!");
  }
}

// 4. Main Function Execution
void main() {
  // Create an instance of Dog
  Dog myDog = Dog();
  // Call makeSound on the Dog object
  myDog.makeSound(); // Output: Woof! Woof!

  // Create an instance of Cat
  Cat myCat = Cat();
  // Call makeSound on the Cat object
  myCat.makeSound(); // Output: Meow! Meow!

  print(''); // Add a blank line for separation

  // --- Optional Bonus: Demonstrating Polymorphism ---
  print("--- Polymorphism Demo ---");

  // Create a list that can hold Animal objects
  // We can add Dog and Cat objects because they ARE Animals (due to inheritance)
  List<Animal> animals = [myDog, myCat];
  // Or create new ones directly: List<Animal> animals = [Dog(), Cat()];

  // Iterate through the list
  for (Animal animal in animals) {
    // Even though the variable 'animal' is of type Animal,
    // Dart calls the overridden method of the ACTUAL object (Dog or Cat).
    // This is polymorphism in action.
    animal.makeSound();
  }
  // Output:
  // Woof! Woof!
  // Meow! Meow!
}
