Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focusing on handling errors with Futures using `async`/`await` and `try`/`catch`.

---

**Problem Description**

**Goal:** Learn how to handle potential errors that might occur during asynchronous operations (represented by `Future`s) in Dart.

**Task:**

1.  **Create an Asynchronous Function with Potential Failure:**
    *   Define a function named `fetchDataFromServer` that accepts a boolean parameter `shouldSucceed`.
    *   This function should return a `Future<String>`.
    *   Inside the function, simulate a network delay of 2 seconds using `Future.delayed`.
    *   After the delay, check the value of `shouldSucceed`:
        *   If `shouldSucceed` is `true`, the `Future` should complete successfully with the value `"Data fetched successfully!"`.
        *   If `shouldSucceed` is `false`, the `Future` should complete with an error. You can achieve this by `throw`ing an `Exception` object (e.g., `throw Exception("Network error: Failed to fetch data.");`).

2.  **Create an Asynchronous Function to Handle the Result/Error:**
    *   Define an `async` function named `processData`.
    *   Inside `processData`, use a `try`/`catch` block.
    *   Inside the `try` block:
        *   Call `fetchDataFromServer`, passing `false` first (to simulate failure). Use `await` to wait for the `Future` to complete.
        *   Store the result in a variable.
        *   Print a message indicating success along with the fetched data (e.g., "Success: [fetched data]").
    *   Inside the `catch` block:
        *   Catch the specific `Exception` (or a general `Object`).
        *   Print an error message indicating that an error occurred and include the error details (e.g., "Error caught: [error details]").
    *   Add a `finally` block (optional but good practice) that prints "Data processing attempt finished."

3.  **Call the Handler Function:**
    *   In your `main` function:
        *   Print a message indicating you are starting the data fetching process for the failure case.
        *   Call `processData()`. Since `processData` is `async`, you'll need to make `main` `async` and `await processData()` if you want `main` to wait for it.
        *   *Challenge (Optional):* Modify `processData` to accept the boolean flag and call it twice from `main` - once to simulate success and once to simulate failure.

**Solution**

```dart
import 'dart:async';

// 1. Asynchronous function that might succeed or fail
Future<String> fetchDataFromServer(bool shouldSucceed) {
  print("Attempting to fetch data... (will succeed: $shouldSucceed)");
  // Simulate network delay
  return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
    if (shouldSucceed) {
      // Simulate successful data fetch
      return "Data fetched successfully!";
    } else {
      // Simulate a network error
      throw Exception("Network error: Failed to fetch data.");
    }
  });
}

// 2. Async function to handle the Future's result or error
// (Modified to accept the flag for the optional challenge part)
Future<void> processData(bool simulateSuccess) async {
  print("\n--- Starting data processing (Simulating ${simulateSuccess ? 'Success' : 'Failure'}) ---");
  try {
    // Attempt to fetch data and wait for the result
    String result = await fetchDataFromServer(simulateSuccess);
    // This line only runs if fetchDataFromServer completes successfully
    print("Success: $result");
  } on Exception catch (e) { // Catching a specific Exception type
    // This block runs if fetchDataFromServer throws an Exception
    print("Error caught: $e");
  } catch (e) { // Catching any other potential errors (good practice)
     print("An unexpected error occurred: $e");
  } finally {
    // This block runs regardless of whether an error occurred or not
    print("Data processing attempt finished.");
    print("----------------------------------------");
  }
}

// 3. Main function to run the process
Future<void> main() async {
  print("Starting application...");

  // Simulate the failure case
  await processData(false);

  // Simulate the success case
  await processData(true);

  print("Application finished.");
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `fetchDataFromServer`: Returns a `Future` that, after a 2-second delay, either resolves to a success string or throws an `Exception` based on the `shouldSucceed` flag.
2.  `processData`: This is an `async` function, allowing the use of `await`.
    *   `try`: We `await` the result of `fetchDataFromServer`. If it succeeds, the result is stored in `result`, and the success message is printed.
    *   `on Exception catch (e)`: If `fetchDataFromServer` throws an `Exception`, execution jumps to this block. The error object (`e`) is caught, and the error message is printed.
    *   `finally`: This block executes after the `try` or `catch` block finishes, ensuring cleanup or final logging happens consistently.
3.  `main`: Marked as `async` so we can use `await` when calling `processData`. This ensures the program waits for one `processData` call to complete (including its internal `await` and error handling) before starting the next one and before printing "Application finished." We call `processData` twice to demonstrate both the success and failure paths.
