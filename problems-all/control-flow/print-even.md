# Printing Even Numbers (1 to 10)

## Problem Description

Write a Dart program that prints all the even numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive).

## Requirements

1.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10.
2.  Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current number is even.
3.  If the number is even, print it to the console.
4.  Remember: A number is even if it is perfectly divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0). You can use the modulo operator (`%`) for this check.

## Focus

This problem focuses on:

*   Using a `for` loop for iteration over a range of numbers.
*   Using an `if` statement for conditional execution.
*   Applying the modulo operator (`%`) to check for divisibility.
*   Working with the `int` data type.
*   Printing output to the console (`print`).

## Boilerplate Code

```dart
void main() {
  print("Even numbers between 1 and 10:");

  // 1. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10
  // for (...) {

    // 2. Inside the loop, check if the number is even using an if statement and the modulo operator
    // if (...) {

      // 3. If even, print the number
      // print(...);

    // }
  // }
}
```
