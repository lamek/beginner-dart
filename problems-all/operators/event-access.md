# Event Access Checker

## Problem Description

Write a Dart program that determines access eligibility based on several boolean conditions using logical operators.

## Requirements

1.  Declare and initialize boolean variables for `isRegistered`, `hasPaid`, `isAccountActive`, and `isEventLive`.
2.  Use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to create boolean expressions for the specified conditions.
3.  Print the results of each boolean expression to the console with descriptive labels.

## Focus

This problem focuses on:

* Declaring boolean variables (`bool`).
* Using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
* Evaluating complex boolean expressions.
* Printing boolean results to the console.

## Boilerplate Code

```dart
void main() {
  // 1. Declare and initialize boolean variables

  // 2. Create boolean expressions to evaluate conditions

  // 3. Print the results
}
