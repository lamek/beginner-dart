# Beginner Dart

Welcome to Beginner Dart! This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Dart programming problems, designed to help you learn and practice the fundamentals of [the Dart programming language](https://dart.dev).

> **IMPORTANT:**
>
> Almost all of the content is this repo is AI-generated -> human-curated.
> The main goals of this repo are as follows:
> 1. Experiment with AI content generation -> human curation
> 2. Create a beginner resouce for new Dart programmers
> 3. Create a repo of beginner level Dart resouces for anyone to use as they wish.

## What's Inside

Currently, this repository contains a growing set of generated Dart problems. These problems are created using AI content generation, allowing for rapid experimentation and expansion.

The plan is to organize these problems into three distinct "views" to cater to different learning styles and needs:

* [**Curated View:**](/docs/curated/intro.md)
    * A carefully selected sequence of problems designed to guide beginner Dart programmers through the language's core concepts in a logical and progressive manner.
    * Think of this as a guided tour of Dart, perfect for those just starting their journey.
* [**Category View:**](/docs/categories/overview.md)
    * Problems grouped by specific Dart categories (e.g., variables, functions, classes, asynchronous programming).
    * Each category will include a brief introduction and explanation of the relevant concepts, making it a valuable resource for focused study or supplemental learning.
* [**Reference View:**](/problems-all/)
    * A comprehensive collection of all generated problems in a single, easily accessible location.
    * This view is ideal for quick reference or for those who prefer to explore problems independently.

## Current Status

* The problems are currently being generated and refined.
* The "views" mentioned above are under development.
* For now, all problems are located in the git repository as markdown files.

## Future Plans

* Continue to experiment with AI content generation to expand the problem set.
* Refine and curate the "views" to provide a high-quality learning experience.
* Potentially build out a dedicated website for improved navigation and presentation.
* Add some docs and share some of the cleaned up scripts used to generate this content
