Okay, here is a beginner Dart problem focusing on `async`/`await` and simulating data fetching with `Future.delayed()`.

---

**Problem Description**

**Goal:** Simulate fetching user data from a remote server and display it.

**Scenario:** Imagine you need to fetch a user's name from an API. This network request takes some time (e.g., 2 seconds). Your task is to create a Dart function that simulates this delay and returns a predefined user name. You must then call this function and print the fetched name once it's available, using `async` and `await` to handle the asynchronous nature of the operation.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Create an asynchronous function:** Name it `fetchUserName`. This function should:
    *   Be marked with the `async` keyword.
    *   Return a `Future<String>`.
    *   Inside the function, print a message like "Fetching user name...".
    *   Use `Future.delayed()` to simulate a 2-second network delay.
    *   After the delay, the `Future` should complete with a hardcoded user name (e.g., "Bob").
    *   Return this user name.
2.  **Call the function from `main`:**
    *   Make the `main` function `async`.
    *   Print a message indicating the program start (e.g., "Program started.").
    *   Call the `fetchUserName` function using `await` to wait for the result.
    *   Store the returned name in a variable.
    *   Print the fetched user name (e.g., "User name fetched: Bob").
    *   Print a message indicating the program end (e.g., "Program finished.").

**Solution Code**

```dart
import 'dart:async'; // Import needed for Future and Duration (though often implicitly available)

// 1. Create an asynchronous function to simulate fetching data
Future<String> fetchUserName() async {
  print('Fetching user name...'); // Indicate the start of the operation

  // Simulate a network delay of 2 seconds using Future.delayed()
  // The second argument to delayed is a function that returns the value
  // after the duration has passed.
  String userName = await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
    return 'Bob'; // This is the simulated data returned after the delay
  });

  // Return the fetched data
  return userName;
}

// 2. Call the asynchronous function from the main function
void main() async { // main must be async to use await inside it
  print('Program started.');

  // Call the async function and wait for its result using await
  // Execution pauses here until fetchUserName completes
  String name = await fetchUserName();

  // Once the Future completes, the result is available in 'name'
  print('User name fetched: $name');

  print('Program finished.');
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `fetchUserName` is marked `async`, allowing the use of `await` inside it. It returns a `Future<String>`, signifying that it will eventually produce a string value.
2.  `Future.delayed()` creates a Future that completes after the specified `Duration`. The optional second argument is a computation that runs after the delay, and its result becomes the value of the Future.
3.  `await` pauses the execution of `fetchUserName` until the `Future.delayed()` completes. It then unwraps the `Future` and assigns the resulting value (`'Bob'`) to the `userName` variable.
4.  `main` is also marked `async` because it uses `await` to call `fetchUserName`.
5.  `await fetchUserName()` pauses the execution of `main` until the `fetchUserName` function completes and returns its value.
6.  The print statements before and after the `await` call in `main` help visualize the asynchronous flow â€“ "Program started" prints immediately, then there's a pause for "Fetching user name..." and the 2-second delay, then "User name fetched: Bob" and "Program finished" print.
